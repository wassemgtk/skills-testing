# SKU Rationalization Advisor

## Overview

SKU Rationalization Advisor systematically evaluates every SKU in a category or portfolio against performance, strategic, and operational criteria to recommend keep/delist/consolidate/replace actions. The goal is to reduce complexity costs and free shelf space or warehouse capacity for higher-potential items without sacrificing meaningful consumer choice.

In CPG retail, the long tail is expensive. Industry analysis shows that the bottom 20% of SKUs typically contribute only 1–3% of revenue but consume 15–25% of inventory carrying costs, supply chain complexity, and shelf space. However, naive pruning destroys value—some low-velocity SKUs serve as strategic traffic drivers, assortment signals, or niche segment anchors. This skill applies a multi-criteria framework to distinguish truly unproductive SKUs from strategically necessary ones.

## When to Use

- Annual assortment reset or planogram reset cycle
- Warehouse or shelf-space capacity constraints require SKU reduction
- Category has grown to excessive SKU count through years of additions without removals
- Supply chain or procurement team flags complexity costs
- Preparing for private label expansion (need shelf space for new PL items)
- Post-acquisition portfolio integration requiring duplicate elimination
- User provides SKU-level data and asks which items to cut

## Required Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| SKU master list | Yes | Full catalog with attributes: brand, size, flavor, segment, pack, price |
| Sales data (12+ weeks) | Yes | Units, revenue, and ideally margin by SKU; 52 weeks preferred |
| Inventory data | Recommended | Average inventory $, turns, days of supply, stockout rate |
| Margin/cost data | Recommended | Gross margin $, gross margin %, COGS, landed cost |
| Distribution data | Recommended | Store count, %ACV, or warehouse allocation |
| Substitution/switching data | Optional | Which SKUs shoppers switch to when one is unavailable |
| Supplier/vendor data | Optional | Supplier dependencies, exclusive arrangements, MOQ requirements |
| Strategic item flags | Optional | Items with contractual obligations, brand commitments, or strategic role |

## Methodology

### Step 1: SKU Performance Scoring

Score every SKU on four dimensions (each 0–100):

**A. Revenue Contribution Score**
```
Revenue Score = (SKU Revenue / Category Revenue) × 10,000
```
Normalize to 0–100 scale. Pareto benchmark: top 20% of SKUs should score > 60.

**B. Profitability Score**
```
Profit Score = (SKU Gross Margin $ / Top-SKU Gross Margin $) × 100
```
If margin data unavailable, use ASP relative to category average as proxy.

**C. Velocity Score**
```
Velocity Score = (SKU Units per Store per Week / Category Avg Units per Store per Week) × 100
```
Cap at 100. Measures inventory productivity and consumer demand intensity.

**D. Trend Score**
```
Trend Score = 50 + (SKU YoY Growth Rate − Category YoY Growth Rate) × 5
```
Centered at 50; above 50 = outperforming category trend, below = underperforming. Cap at 0–100.

**Composite Score** (weighted):
```
Composite = (Revenue × 0.30) + (Profit × 0.30) + (Velocity × 0.25) + (Trend × 0.15)
```

### Step 2: Strategic Role Assessment

Assign each SKU a strategic role that may override pure performance scores:

| Role | Definition | Protection Level |
|---|---|---|
| **Traffic Driver** | Generates store/site visits; high search volume, destination item | High — keep even if margin is low |
| **Basket Builder** | High attach rate; frequently bought with other items | Medium-High |
| **Margin Anchor** | Above-average margin %; may have low velocity | Medium |
| **Assortment Signal** | Represents a segment that defines category credibility | Medium — keep at least 1 SKU |
| **Niche/Loyalty** | Small but fiercely loyal customer base; high repeat rate | Medium — evaluate switching risk |
| **Filler/Redundant** | No unique role; interchangeable with other SKUs | Low — primary delist candidate |

### Step 3: Redundancy & Cannibalization Analysis

Identify clusters of overlapping SKUs:

1. Group SKUs by attribute similarity (same brand + same segment + similar price ± 10%)
2. Within each cluster, calculate **Incremental Contribution**: revenue that would be lost if the SKU were removed (net of substitution to remaining SKUs)
3. Apply a **Substitution Rate** assumption: typically 40–65% for CPG (i.e., 40–65% of a delisted SKU's sales transfer to remaining items)

```
Net Revenue at Risk = SKU Revenue × (1 − Substitution Rate)
```

### Step 4: Action Classification

Based on Composite Score, Strategic Role, and Redundancy:

| Composite Score | Strategic Role | Redundancy | Recommended Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| > 60 | Any | Any | **Keep** — core performer |
| 40–60 | Traffic/Basket/Signal | Low | **Keep** — strategically important |
| 40–60 | Filler | High | **Consolidate** — merge with stronger variant |
| 20–40 | Any non-critical | High | **Replace** — swap for higher-potential alternative |
| < 20 | Filler/Redundant | Any | **Delist** — remove from assortment |
| < 20 | Niche/Loyalty | Low | **Review** — manual decision required |

### Step 5: Impact Simulation

Simulate the impact of recommended delistments:

```
Total Delist Revenue = Σ (Delisted SKU Revenue)
Retained Revenue = Σ (Delisted SKU Revenue × Substitution Rate)
Net Revenue Loss = Total Delist Revenue − Retained Revenue
Complexity Savings = # SKUs Removed × Cost per SKU (inventory carry + handling + space)
Net Impact = Complexity Savings − Net Revenue Loss
```

Industry benchmark: Cost per SKU ranges from $5,000–$50,000/year depending on category and supply chain complexity.

## Analysis Framework

### Key Metrics

- **SKU Productivity**: Revenue per SKU (benchmark: top quartile > 2× category average)
- **Pareto Ratio**: % of revenue from top 20% of SKUs (benchmark: 75–85%)
- **Long-Tail Burden**: % of SKUs contributing < 0.1% of category revenue
- **Inventory Turns by SKU**: Turns < 4×/year in center store signals overstock or low demand
- **Incremental Contribution**: Revenue uniquely attributable to the SKU (not transferable)
- **Complexity Cost per SKU**: Fully loaded cost including procurement, warehousing, handling, shelf management
- **Customer Reach**: % of total buyers who purchased the SKU in the last 52 weeks

### Decision Thresholds

- Delist threshold: Bottom 15–25% of SKUs by composite score, unless strategically protected
- Minimum viable assortment: At least 1 SKU per decision-tree node that has demonstrated demand
- Maximum delist batch: Recommend no more than 15% of SKU count in a single reset to manage disruption
- Substitution rate validation: If observed switching data is available, use it; otherwise apply category-level default (50%)

## Examples

**Input**: "We have 1,200 SKUs in our Home Cleaning category. Management wants to reduce to 900 SKUs while maintaining at least 95% of current revenue. Here's our 52-week sales, margin, and inventory data."

**Output**:
1. **Scoring**: 1,200 SKUs scored; 187 score below 20 (delist zone), 124 score 20–40 (replace zone), remaining 889 score > 40
2. **Redundancy**: 93 SKU clusters identified with high overlap; 156 SKUs are redundant within clusters
3. **Recommendations**: Delist 168 SKUs, consolidate 84 into 42, replace 48 → net reduction of 258 SKUs (to 942)
4. **Impact**: Gross revenue at risk $4.2M (3.8%); estimated retained after substitution $2.9M; net loss $1.3M (1.2%). Complexity savings: $2.1M/year. Net benefit: +$0.8M/year.
5. **Top delist clusters**: 14 niche air freshener variants (0.3% of revenue, 1.2% of SKUs), 22 legacy packaging sizes in dish soap, 11 private label duplicates with identical formulations

## Guidelines

- Never recommend delisting the only SKU serving a valid consumer need state — that creates an assortment gap
- Apply a "buyer count" safety check: if a SKU has > 2% of category buyers, flag for manual review even if scores are low
- Consider seasonal SKUs separately — annualized metrics understate their in-season importance
- Respect contractual and promotional commitments; flag timing constraints for delistments
- Communicate delist recommendations with sensitivity: provide data-backed rationale, not just scores
- Stagger delistments over 2–3 reset windows rather than a single mass cut
- Monitor post-delist performance for 8–12 weeks; have contingency to relist if substitution doesn't materialize
- Always pair rationalization with gap-fill recommendations (use Assortment Gap Analysis skill) — rationalize and renovate simultaneously
