# Price Elasticity Estimator

## Overview

Price Elasticity Estimator quantifies the relationship between price changes and demand response for CPG and retail products. It computes own-price elasticity coefficients, models cross-price effects, and simulates the revenue and margin impact of proposed price changes. This enables data-driven pricing decisions that balance volume, revenue, and margin objectives.

Price elasticity is the single most important input to pricing strategy. A product with elasticity of −2.0 will lose 10% of volume for every 5% price increase; knowing this allows precise trade-off analysis. In CPG, typical own-price elasticities range from −1.5 to −3.5, varying significantly by category, brand equity, competitive set, and channel.

## When to Use

- Evaluating the impact of a proposed price increase or decrease
- Annual pricing review or cost-driven price adjustment planning
- Competitive response analysis — "if competitor drops price by 10%, what happens to our volume?"
- Promotion depth optimization — determining optimal temporary price reduction
- Private label pricing strategy relative to national brands
- Building pricing architecture (good/better/best tiering)
- User provides historical price and volume data and asks about price sensitivity

## Required Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Historical price & volume data | Yes | Weekly or monthly price points and corresponding unit sales; minimum 52 weeks, ideally 104+ weeks |
| SKU/product attributes | Yes | Brand, size, segment, price tier classification |
| Promotion flags | Recommended | Indicator of when prices reflect temporary promotions vs. EDLP |
| Competitor pricing | Recommended | Price points for key competitive SKUs over the same period |
| Distribution data | Recommended | Store count or %ACV to normalize volume (units/store/week) |
| Cost data | Optional | COGS or landed cost per unit for margin analysis |
| Seasonality indicators | Optional | Season or holiday flags to control for demand fluctuations |

## Methodology

### Step 1: Data Preparation

1. **Normalize volume**: Convert raw units to units per store per week (or per thousand site visits for e-commerce) to remove distribution effects
2. **Identify price variation**: Catalog all price points observed; flag regular price vs. promoted price
3. **Remove outliers**: Exclude weeks with stockouts, extreme events (pandemic, recalls), or data errors
4. **Create log transformations**: ln(Price) and ln(Volume) for log-log regression (constant elasticity model)
5. **Construct control variables**: seasonality dummies, trend variable, holiday flags, competitor price indices

### Step 2: Elasticity Estimation

Apply the log-log demand model:

```
ln(Q_it) = α + β₁·ln(P_it) + β₂·ln(P_competitor_t) + β₃·Promo_it + β₄·Season_t + β₅·Trend_t + ε_it
```

Where:
- **β₁** = Own-price elasticity (expected: negative, typically −1.5 to −3.5)
- **β₂** = Cross-price elasticity (expected: positive for substitutes)
- **β₃** = Promotion lift coefficient
- **Q_it** = Units per point of distribution for product i in period t
- **P_it** = Price of product i in period t

**Estimation methods** (in order of preference):
1. **OLS with controls**: Adequate when price variation is exogenous (e.g., cost-driven changes)
2. **Two-stage least squares (2SLS/IV)**: Use commodity cost indices as instruments when price is endogenous
3. **Difference-in-differences**: When a price change occurs at a specific date, compare treated vs. control stores/products
4. **Bayesian hierarchical model**: For estimating elasticities across many SKUs with limited data per SKU

### Step 3: Elasticity Segmentation

Group products by elasticity profile:

| Elasticity Range | Classification | Typical Products | Pricing Implication |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 to −1.0 | Inelastic | Staples, baby formula, pet food, addictive categories | Price increases recover margin with limited volume loss |
| −1.0 to −2.0 | Moderate | Most center-store CPG, branded household products | Careful trade-off analysis needed; brand equity matters |
| −2.0 to −3.0 | Elastic | Commoditized categories, snacks, beverages, private label | Price increases risk significant volume loss |
| < −3.0 | Highly Elastic | Price-comparison categories, undifferentiated products | Compete on value; price increases very risky |

### Step 4: Scenario Simulation

For each proposed price change, compute expected outcomes:

```
% ΔVolume = Elasticity × % ΔPrice
New Volume = Current Volume × (1 + % ΔVolume)
New Revenue = New Volume × New Price
ΔRevenue = New Revenue − Current Revenue
ΔMargin = (New Price − Cost) × New Volume − (Current Price − Cost) × Current Volume
```

**Optimal price** (margin-maximizing):
```
P* = Cost × (ε / (1 + ε))
```
Where ε is own-price elasticity (negative value). This formula yields the theoretical margin-maximizing price assuming constant elasticity.

**Revenue-maximizing price**:
```
P_rev* = P_current / (1 + 1/ε)
```

### Step 5: Cross-Price and Cannibalization Effects

For products within a portfolio, estimate cross-price elasticities to understand:

- **Substitution effects**: If Brand A raises price, how much volume shifts to Brand B
- **Category expansion/contraction**: Does the price change grow or shrink total category volume
- **Private label cross-elasticity**: Measure PL volume response to national brand price changes (typically 0.1–0.5)

```
Cross-Elasticity_AB = % ΔVolume_B / % ΔPrice_A
```
Positive values indicate substitutes; negative values indicate complements.

### Step 6: Confidence and Sensitivity Analysis

Report confidence intervals around elasticity estimates and simulate across the range:

- **95% confidence interval** for the elasticity coefficient
- **Optimistic scenario**: Use lower-bound elasticity (less elastic)
- **Base scenario**: Use point estimate
- **Pessimistic scenario**: Use upper-bound elasticity (more elastic)
- **Break-even price change**: The price increase at which margin gain equals zero

## Analysis Framework

### Key Metrics

- **Own-Price Elasticity**: % change in quantity / % change in price
- **Arc Elasticity**: For discrete price changes: ((Q2−Q1)/(Q2+Q1)) / ((P2−P1)/(P2+P1))
- **Revenue Elasticity**: Own-price elasticity + 1 (if > 0, revenue increases with price increase)
- **Margin Elasticity**: Captures margin impact factoring in cost; more relevant than revenue elasticity for profitability
- **Price Gap Ratio**: Brand price / competitive set average price (healthy: 1.0–1.3 for premium brands)
- **Promotional Elasticity**: Separate elasticity during promoted periods (typically 1.5–3× everyday elasticity)
- **Break-Even Volume Loss**: The maximum % volume decline that still yields positive margin impact: `%ΔVolume_max = -%ΔPrice / (CM% + %ΔPrice)` where CM% = contribution margin %

### Industry Benchmarks

| Category | Typical Own-Price Elasticity |
|---|---|
| Baby care / diapers | −1.0 to −1.5 |
| Household cleaners | −1.5 to −2.0 |
| Carbonated soft drinks | −2.0 to −2.8 |
| Salty snacks | −1.8 to −2.5 |
| Paper products | −1.5 to −2.2 |
| Fresh produce | −0.5 to −1.5 |
| Private label (avg) | −2.5 to −3.5 |

## Examples

**Input**: "We want to take a 7% price increase on our top 5 laundry detergent SKUs (branded, liquid, mid-tier). We have 104 weeks of POS data with weekly price points and units across 2,400 stores. What will happen to volume, revenue, and margin?"

**Output**:
1. **Elasticity estimates**: SKU-level elasticities range from −1.6 to −2.1 (avg −1.85), consistent with household cleaners category benchmarks
2. **Scenario at +7%**: Expected volume decline of −13.0% (range: −11.2% to −14.7%). Revenue impact: +$2.1M (net positive because volume loss is partially offset by higher price). Margin impact: +$4.8M (strongly positive due to margin expansion on remaining volume).
3. **Break-even**: Volume can decline up to −18.4% before the price increase becomes margin-negative
4. **Cross-price effect**: Competitor liquid detergent gains an estimated +3.2% volume; private label gains +5.8% volume
5. **Recommendation**: Proceed with +7% increase; monitor competitive response and volume weekly for 8 weeks. If volume declines exceed 15%, consider partial rollback or promotional mitigation.

## Guidelines

- Minimum 52 weeks of data for reliable estimation; 104+ weeks strongly preferred for seasonality control
- Always separate regular-price elasticity from promotional elasticity — they differ substantially
- Never extrapolate elasticity estimates beyond the observed price range (e.g., don't assume a 30% increase will follow the same elasticity measured from 5% variations)
- Elasticity is not constant across the demand curve; acknowledge this limitation when using the constant-elasticity (log-log) model
- Control for competitor actions: if a competitor raised prices simultaneously, your observed elasticity will be biased toward inelastic
- Beware of reverse causality: managers often cut prices when volume is already declining, biasing elasticity toward inelastic. Use instrumental variables if possible.
- Private label elasticity is almost always higher (more elastic) than national brand; don't apply one estimate to both
- Consider reference price effects: consumers respond more negatively to price increases than positively to decreases (loss aversion)
- Report confidence intervals; a point estimate of −2.0 with a 95% CI of [−0.5, −3.5] is not actionable
- Validate elasticity estimates against industry benchmarks; if your estimate is dramatically different, investigate why
