# Market Expansion Readiness Assessment

## Overview

Conduct a structured, multi-dimensional viability assessment for CPG market expansion opportunities. This skill evaluates demand potential, supply chain feasibility, regulatory complexity, competitive intensity, and financial attractiveness to produce a quantified readiness score and go/no-go recommendation.

## When to Use

- Evaluating entry into a new geographic market (domestic or international)
- Assessing a new retail channel (e.g., Club, Dollar, C-Store, Quick Commerce)
- Reviewing international expansion opportunities
- Prioritizing among multiple expansion candidates
- Annual strategic planning — market portfolio optimization

## Required Inputs

| Input | Description | Format |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Target market(s) | Region, country, or channel under evaluation | Name + geographic scope |
| Category data | Market size, growth rate, per-capita consumption | $ and unit volume |
| Current footprint | Existing markets, revenue, margin profile | Summary by region/channel |
| Product portfolio | SKUs under consideration for expansion | List with COGS and ASP |
| Competitive landscape | Key competitors, market shares, positioning | Qualitative + quantitative |
| Regulatory requirements | Known labeling, import, compliance requirements | Text summary |
| Supply chain constraints | Manufacturing locations, logistics capabilities | Facility list + lead times |

## Methodology

### Step 1: Market Attractiveness Scoring (40% of total score)

Evaluate across five sub-dimensions, each scored 1-5:

| Sub-Dimension | Weight | Scoring Criteria |
|---------------|--------|-----------------|
| Market Size | 30% | 1=<$50M TAM; 3=$50-500M; 5=>$500M |
| Growth Rate | 25% | 1=<2% CAGR; 3=2-8%; 5=>8% |
| Per-Capita Consumption Gap | 20% | 1=at parity; 5=significant under-penetration |
| Price Realization Potential | 15% | 1=heavy price pressure; 5=premium pricing viable |
| Category Development Index | 10% | CDI vs national average: 1=<60; 3=60-100; 5=>100 |

### Step 2: Competitive Position Assessment (20% of total score)

| Sub-Dimension | Weight | Scoring Criteria |
|---------------|--------|-----------------|
| Competitor Concentration | 35% | 1=monopoly; 3=oligopoly; 5=fragmented |
| Brand Awareness Transfer | 25% | 1=no awareness; 5=strong brand equity in market |
| Differentiation Opportunity | 25% | 1=commodity; 5=clear white space |
| Retailer Relationship Leverage | 15% | 1=no relationships; 5=existing partnerships |

### Step 3: Supply Chain & Operational Feasibility (20% of total score)

| Sub-Dimension | Weight | Scoring Criteria |
|---------------|--------|-----------------|
| Manufacturing Proximity | 30% | 1=>5000 miles; 3=1000-5000; 5=<1000 miles |
| Cold Chain / Logistics | 25% | 1=no infrastructure; 5=mature logistics network |
| Regulatory Compliance Burden | 25% | 1=extensive reformulation; 5=no changes needed |
| Co-Packer / 3PL Availability | 20% | 1=none; 5=multiple qualified options |

### Step 4: Financial Viability Analysis (20% of total score)

Build a 3-year discounted contribution margin model:

```
Year 1-3 Revenue = Addressable Distribution Points × Velocity Assumption × ASP
COGS = Base COGS + Incremental Logistics + Tariff/Duty
Gross Profit = Revenue − COGS
Contribution = Gross Profit − Trade Spend − Slotting − Market Entry A&P
NPV = Σ (Contribution_t / (1 + WACC)^t) − Initial Investment
```

Score: 1=negative NPV at year 5; 3=breakeven by year 3; 5=positive NPV by year 2

### Step 5: Risk Assessment

Apply a structured risk matrix across:

| Risk Category | Assessment Areas |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Political/Regulatory | Trade policy stability, regulatory predictability |
| Currency/Economic | FX volatility, inflation, tariff exposure |
| Execution | Team capability, partner reliability, timeline risk |
| Cannibalization | Impact on existing market/channel revenue |
| Reputational | Brand perception risk in new market |

Rate each: Probability (1-5) × Impact (1-5) = Risk Score. Flag any score ≥15 as critical.

### Step 6: Composite Scoring and Recommendation

```
Readiness Score = (Market Attractiveness × 0.40)
                + (Competitive Position × 0.20)
                + (Supply Chain Feasibility × 0.20)
                + (Financial Viability × 0.20)

Scale: 1.0-5.0
```

| Score Range | Recommendation |
|-------------|---------------|
| 4.0-5.0 | Strong Go — prioritize for immediate investment |
| 3.0-3.9 | Conditional Go — proceed with identified mitigations |
| 2.0-2.9 | Hold — requires significant capability building |
| 1.0-1.9 | No-Go — insufficient readiness |

## Analysis Framework

**Porter's Five Forces Application**:
- Supplier power: Ingredient/packaging sourcing in new market
- Buyer power: Retailer concentration and negotiating leverage
- Substitutes: Private label and adjacent category threats
- New entrants: Barriers to entry that protect post-entry
- Rivalry: Intensity and basis of competition

**PESTEL Scan**: Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, Legal factors specific to target market and category.

## Example

**Input**: "Evaluate expansion of our premium snack brand into the UK market. Current revenue is US-only at $200M. UK snack market is $8B growing 4% with fragmented competition."

**Output excerpt**:
> "**Composite Readiness Score: 3.7 — Conditional Go.** The UK premium snack market presents a $300M addressable opportunity within a fragmented competitive landscape (top 3 players hold 35% combined share), offering meaningful white space for a differentiated US brand. Supply chain feasibility scores moderately (3.2/5.0) due to the need for a European co-packing partner and HFSS regulatory compliance on 40% of the portfolio. Financial modeling indicates breakeven contribution by month 22 at 1,500 distribution points, with £2.8M required pre-launch investment. Critical path items: (1) secure FSA-compliant labeling for full portfolio by Q2, (2) execute co-packer qualification by Q3, (3) confirm Tesco/Sainsbury's category review timing."

## Guidelines

- Score every sub-dimension with explicit evidence — no unsubstantiated ratings
- Always include cannibalization analysis for adjacent market expansion
- Financial models must use conservative velocity assumptions (benchmark: 50th percentile of category)
- Include explicit kill criteria: conditions under which the expansion should be halted
- Sensitivity test the top 3 assumptions (±20%) and show NPV impact
- Document data sources and confidence levels for each input
