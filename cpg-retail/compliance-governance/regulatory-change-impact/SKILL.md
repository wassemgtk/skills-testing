# Regulatory Change Impact Assessment

## Overview

Translate regulatory changes into business impact assessments for CPG operations. This skill evaluates new or proposed regulations across operational, financial, legal, and competitive dimensions to produce actionable impact briefs that enable informed decision-making by leadership. Covers FDA, FTC, EPA, CPSC, USDA, state-level laws, and international regulations affecting CPG products.

## When to Use

- New FDA labeling or ingredient regulation (e.g., front-of-pack labeling, HFSS restrictions)
- State-level law changes (e.g., Proposition 65 updates, EPR laws, bottle bills)
- Environmental/sustainability regulations (e.g., packaging mandates, carbon reporting)
- Trade policy changes (tariffs, import restrictions, country-of-origin labeling)
- FTC enforcement shifts (Green Guides updates, advertising standard changes)
- International regulation affecting export markets (EU, UK, APAC requirements)
- Pre-rulemaking public comment preparation
- Annual regulatory landscape scan and prioritization

## Required Inputs

| Input | Description | Format |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Regulation details | Full text or summary of the regulation | Document, link, or summary |
| Product portfolio | Products potentially affected | SKU/brand list with attributes |
| Current compliance status | How current operations align (or don't) with new requirements | Assessment |
| Geographic scope | Markets where the regulation applies | State/country list |
| Revenue exposure | Revenue from affected products in affected markets | $ by product/market |
| Compliance timeline | Effective date and key milestones | Dates |
| Industry intelligence | How competitors/industry are responding | Optional context |

## Methodology

### Step 1: Regulation Deconstruction

Break the regulation into its component requirements:

```
Regulation: [Name / Citation]
Issuing Authority: [FDA, FTC, EPA, State, etc.]
Status: [Proposed Rule / Final Rule / Effective / Enforcement Date]
Key Dates:
  - Published: [Date]
  - Comment period closes: [Date] (if proposed)
  - Effective date: [Date]
  - Enforcement date: [Date]
  - Full compliance deadline: [Date]

Requirement Breakdown:
1. [Specific requirement 1 — what must you do?]
2. [Specific requirement 2]
3. [Specific requirement 3]

Applicability Criteria:
  - Product types covered: [Categories, ingredients, claims]
  - Company size thresholds: [Revenue, employee count if applicable]
  - Geographic scope: [Federal, state-specific, international]
  - Exemptions: [Any exemptions that might apply]
```

### Step 2: Portfolio Exposure Assessment

Map the regulation's requirements against your product portfolio:

**Product Impact Matrix:**
| Product/Brand | Affected? | Requirement Gap | Compliance Effort | Revenue Exposed |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Brand A, SKU 1 | Yes | Reformulation needed | High | $XM |
| Brand A, SKU 2 | Yes | Label change only | Medium | $XM |
| Brand B | No | Exempt (category) | None | — |
| Brand C | Partial | Packaging change | Low | $XM |

**Exposure Summary:**
```
Total Portfolio Revenue:                    $XXM
Revenue from Affected Products:             $XXM (XX% of total)
Revenue from Products Requiring Changes:    $XXM (XX% of total)
Revenue at Risk (if non-compliant):         $XXM
```

### Step 3: Operational Impact Assessment

Evaluate the operational changes required across the value chain:

| Function | Impact Area | Change Required | Effort | Timeline |
|----------|-----------|----------------|--------|----------|
| R&D/Product Development | Reformulation | Modify X ingredients/formulas | High/Med/Low | X months |
| Regulatory Affairs | Registration/filing | Submit X registrations/notifications | High/Med/Low | X months |
| Packaging/Design | Label redesign | Update X SKU labels/packaging | High/Med/Low | X months |
| Supply Chain | Sourcing | Qualify X new suppliers/ingredients | High/Med/Low | X months |
| Manufacturing | Production | Modify X processes/lines | High/Med/Low | X months |
| Quality | Testing | Implement X new test protocols | High/Med/Low | X months |
| Marketing | Claims | Revise X marketing materials/claims | High/Med/Low | X months |
| Legal | Contracts | Update X supplier/retailer agreements | High/Med/Low | X months |
| Sales | Retailer communication | Brief X retail partners | Low | X weeks |

### Step 4: Financial Impact Quantification

Calculate the total cost of compliance and non-compliance:

**Cost of Compliance:**
```
One-Time Costs:
  Reformulation/R&D:           $XXK (ingredient testing, stability studies)
  Packaging redesign:          $XXK (design, plate changes, obsolete inventory)
  Regulatory filings:          $XXK (registration fees, consultant costs)
  System updates:              $XXK (ERP, labeling systems)
  Employee training:           $XXK
  Legal review:                $XXK
  Total One-Time:              $XXK

Ongoing Annual Costs:
  Ingredient cost changes:     $XXK/year (reformulated products)
  Testing/certification:       $XXK/year (ongoing compliance testing)
  Reporting/documentation:     $XXK/year (regulatory submissions)
  Total Annual:                $XXK/year

3-Year Total Compliance Cost:  $XXK
```

**Cost of Non-Compliance:**
```
Penalties:
  Per-violation fine:          $XX (cite maximum penalty)
  Estimated violations:        XX per year
  Annual penalty exposure:     $XXK

Business Impact:
  Product seizure/injunction risk:    $XXM (revenue from non-compliant products)
  Retailer delisting risk:            $XXM (retailers requiring compliance)
  Consumer litigation exposure:       $XXM (class action risk)
  Reputational damage:                Qualitative — brand trust erosion

Total Non-Compliance Exposure:        $XXM (annualized)
Compliance ROI = Non-Compliance Cost / Compliance Cost = X.Xx
```

### Step 5: Competitive and Strategic Impact

Assess how the regulation affects competitive dynamics:

**Competitive Analysis:**
| Competitor | Likely Compliance Status | Speed to Market | Competitive Implication |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Competitor A | Already compliant (early mover) | Immediate | May gain shelf space |
| Competitor B | Similar position to us | 6-12 months | Neutral |
| Private Label | May lag (resource constraints) | 12-18 months | Opportunity for branded |
| New Entrants | Born compliant | Immediate | Lower barrier for compliant brands |

**Strategic Implications:**
```
1. First-mover advantage: Is there a benefit to early compliance?
2. Market share shift: Will non-compliant competitors lose share?
3. Innovation catalyst: Does the regulation enable differentiation?
4. Barrier to entry: Does compliance complexity favor incumbents?
5. Consumer perception: Will compliance enhance brand trust?
```

### Step 6: Timeline and Action Planning

Build a compliance roadmap:

```
Compliance Roadmap:

Phase 1: Assessment (Weeks 1-4)
  □ Complete portfolio impact assessment
  □ Identify reformulation needs
  □ Quantify financial impact
  □ Brief leadership

Phase 2: Planning (Weeks 5-12)
  □ Develop reformulation roadmap
  □ Begin label redesign
  □ Engage regulatory counsel
  □ File public comments (if proposed rule)

Phase 3: Execution (Months 4-X)
  □ Execute reformulations with stability testing
  □ Produce new labels/packaging
  □ Update marketing materials
  □ Train relevant teams

Phase 4: Validation (Months X-Y)
  □ Verify compliance across all affected SKUs
  □ Conduct internal audit
  □ Document compliance evidence
  □ Communicate to retailers/partners

Phase 5: Ongoing Monitoring
  □ Monitor regulatory updates and guidance documents
  □ Track industry enforcement actions
  □ Maintain compliance documentation
  □ Annual compliance re-certification
```

### Step 7: Public Comment Strategy (if Proposed Rule)

If the regulation is still in the proposed rule stage:

```
Comment Strategy Assessment:
  1. Does the proposed rule have a significant business impact? (>$100K)
  2. Are there specific provisions that are overly burdensome or unclear?
  3. Does the company have data or evidence that supports modification?
  4. Are industry associations filing coordinated comments?
  5. Is direct company comment submission appropriate in addition to trade association?

Comment Priorities:
  - [Provision A]: Request [specific modification] because [data-backed rationale]
  - [Provision B]: Support as written — aligns with our current practices
  - [Provision C]: Request extended compliance timeline due to [reason]
```

## Analysis Framework

**Regulatory Impact Severity Matrix:**
| | Low Revenue Exposure (<5%) | High Revenue Exposure (>5%) |
|---|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Low Compliance Cost (<$100K) | Monitor | Comply promptly |
| High Compliance Cost (>$100K) | Cost-benefit analysis needed | Strategic priority — board-level decision |

## Example

**Input**: "FDA is proposing mandatory front-of-pack nutrition labeling showing added sugar, sodium, and saturated fat with a 'high in' warning symbol. Comment period closes in 60 days."

**Analysis excerpt**:
> "**Revenue exposed: $145M (62% of portfolio)** across 84 SKUs that would trigger at least one 'high in' warning symbol based on proposed thresholds. **Cost of compliance**: $380K one-time (label redesign for 84 SKUs, 12 requiring reformulation) + $120K/year ongoing (reformulation ingredient costs). **Cost of non-compliance**: Estimated $2.1M penalty exposure + probable retailer enforcement ahead of FDA (Walmart and Target have historically required early adoption). **Strategic opportunity**: 28 SKUs (22% of portfolio revenue) would carry zero warning symbols, creating a marketing advantage if competitors' products are flagged. **Recommended actions**: (1) File public comment within 45 days requesting 24-month compliance timeline (vs proposed 18 months) and threshold adjustments on added sugar from 6.5g to 10g based on serving size rationalization. (2) Begin immediate reformulation of top 5 SKUs by revenue to remove 'high in' designation. (3) Develop 'better-for-you' marketing strategy for compliant SKUs."

## Guidelines

- Always translate regulation into business impact — leadership needs "so what," not legal text
- Quantify both compliance cost and non-compliance cost to frame the decision
- Include competitive analysis — regulations create winners and losers
- For proposed rules, always assess the public comment opportunity
- Track regulatory trajectory, not just current status — where is this heading?
- Distinguish between what's required and what's recommended (guidance vs mandate)
- Identify interdependencies between regulations (e.g., state laws vs federal preemption)
- This is a business impact assessment, not legal compliance guidance — involve legal counsel
