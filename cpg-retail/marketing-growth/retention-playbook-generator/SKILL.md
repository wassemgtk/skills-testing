# Retention Playbook Generator

## Overview

This skill produces an end-to-end retention playbook covering every stage of the post-acquisition customer lifecycle — from first purchase through advocacy. It specifies exact trigger conditions, communication sequences, channel strategies, offer structures, and success metrics for each lifecycle stage, calibrated to CPG and retail e-commerce purchase dynamics.

## When to Use

- Designing or overhauling a retention marketing program
- Building automated lifecycle email/SMS/push workflows
- Improving repeat purchase rate, customer retention, or LTV
- Launching or optimizing a loyalty or rewards program
- Creating win-back and reactivation campaigns
- Establishing retention KPIs and measurement frameworks

## Required Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Product Category | Yes | CPG subcategory (food, beauty, supplements, household, etc.) |
| Average Repurchase Cycle | Yes | Typical time between repeat purchases (days) |
| Current Retention Metrics | Yes | Repeat purchase rate, retention rate, churn rate (if known) |
| Channels Available | Yes | Email, SMS, push notification, direct mail, in-app, loyalty program |
| AOV | Recommended | Average order value for offer calibration |
| Customer Base Size | Recommended | For volume estimates and cost projections |
| Current Lifecycle Flows | No | Existing automated sequences to audit and improve |
| Loyalty Program Details | No | Current program structure, tiers, rewards |
| Tech Stack | No | ESP, CRM, CDP, e-commerce platform for implementation guidance |

## Methodology

### Step 1 — Lifecycle Stage Definition

Define the customer lifecycle stages with transition criteria:

```
New Customer → Developing → Established → VIP → Champion
       ↓            ↓            ↓         ↓
    Lapsed      At Risk      Declining   Dormant → Lost
```

| Stage | Definition | Transition Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| **New** | First purchase, 0–30 days | Order #1 placed |
| **Developing** | 2nd purchase made, building habit | Order #2 within 2× repurchase cycle |
| **Established** | 3+ purchases, consistent buyer | Order #3+ with regular cadence |
| **VIP** | Top 10% by LTV or frequency | Crosses LTV/frequency threshold |
| **Champion** | VIP + advocacy behavior | Referrals, reviews, UGC, social mentions |
| **At Risk** | Purchase gap exceeding 1.5× cycle | Recency gap > 1.5× expected interval |
| **Lapsed** | No purchase for 2× cycle | Recency gap > 2× expected interval |
| **Dormant** | No purchase for 3× cycle | Recency gap > 3× expected interval |
| **Lost** | No purchase for 4× cycle + no engagement | Unresponsive to all reactivation attempts |

### Step 2 — Stage-Specific Playbook Construction

#### Stage: New Customer (First 30 Days)

**Objective**: Drive 2nd purchase; build brand relationship

**Flow: Post-Purchase Welcome Series**

| Touchpoint | Timing | Channel | Content | Goal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Order Confirmation | Immediate | Email | Order details + brand story intro | Set expectations |
| Shipping Notification | On ship | Email/SMS | Tracking + excitement builder | Anticipation |
| Delivery Follow-Up | Day 2 post-delivery | Email | Usage tips, how-to content | Product success |
| Review Request | Day 7 post-delivery | Email | Star rating + review prompt | Social proof |
| Education Content | Day 10 | Email | Brand values, ingredient story, behind-the-scenes | Emotional connection |
| Reorder Nudge | Day 14–21 (pre-repurchase cycle) | Email + SMS | "Running low?" + easy reorder | 2nd purchase |
| Subscription Pitch | Day 21 | Email | Subscribe & save value prop | Subscription conversion |
| Incentivized Reorder | Day 28 (if no 2nd order) | Email + SMS | 10% off 2nd order | Urgency |

**KPI Targets**:
- 2nd purchase rate within 60 days: 30%–40% (consumable CPG), 15%–25% (semi-durable)
- Welcome series email open rate: 50%+
- Subscription conversion (if applicable): 10%–15% of new customers

#### Stage: Developing Customer (Orders 2–3)

**Objective**: Build purchase habit; expand basket

**Flow: Habit-Building Series**

| Touchpoint | Timing | Channel | Content | Goal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Thank You + Cross-Sell | Day 1 post 2nd order | Email | Thank you + complementary product recommendation | Basket expansion |
| Loyalty Enrollment | Day 3 post 2nd order | Email + in-app | Loyalty program invitation with bonus points | Program enrollment |
| Category Education | Day 10 | Email | "Customers also love..." content + social proof | Cross-category awareness |
| Reorder Reminder | Pre-repurchase cycle | Email + SMS | Personalized reorder based on purchase history | 3rd purchase |
| Bundle Offer | If 3rd order delayed | Email | Curated bundle at 10%–15% discount | Conversion + AOV growth |

**KPI Targets**:
- 3rd purchase rate: 55%–65% of those who made 2nd purchase
- Cross-sell acceptance: 15%–20%
- Loyalty enrollment: 40%–50% of 2nd-time buyers

#### Stage: Established Customer (3+ Orders)

**Objective**: Maintain cadence; increase AOV and share of wallet

**Flow: Relationship Deepening**

| Touchpoint | Frequency | Channel | Content | Goal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Personalized Recommendations | Monthly | Email | ML-driven product suggestions based on purchase history | Cross-sell, AOV |
| New Product Announcements | On launch | Email + push | First-to-know access for new products | Engagement, AOV |
| Loyalty Status Update | Monthly | Email + in-app | Points balance, tier progress, rewards available | Loyalty engagement |
| Replenishment Reminders | Cycle-based | SMS + push | Smart reorder based on estimated consumption rate | Repeat purchase |
| Seasonal Campaigns | Quarterly | Email | Seasonal product bundles, gift sets | AOV, category expansion |
| Feedback & Co-Creation | Quarterly | Email + survey | Product preferences, new flavor/scent votes | Emotional investment |

**KPI Targets**:
- Annual retention rate: 70%–80%
- AOV growth: 5%–10% YoY
- Category penetration: expand from avg 1.5 to 2.5 categories

#### Stage: VIP Customer (Top 10%)

**Objective**: Maximize lifetime value; cultivate advocacy

**Flow: VIP Experience**

| Touchpoint | Frequency | Channel | Content |
|---|---|---|---|
| VIP Welcome | On qualification | Email + direct mail | VIP kit: handwritten note, exclusive samples, tier benefits |

- VIP retention rate: 85%–95%
- VIP referral rate: 15%–25%
- VIP AOV premium vs. average: 2×–3×

#### Stage: At Risk → Lapsed → Dormant

**Objective**: Prevent churn and reactivate

**Flow: Win-Back Ladder**

| Stage | Timing | Touchpoint | Offer | Channel |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| At Risk | 1.5× cycle | "We noticed you've been away" | Personalized recommendation (no discount) | Email |
| At Risk | 1.75× cycle | Soft incentive | Free shipping on next order | Email + SMS |
| Lapsed | 2× cycle | Win-back offer | 15% off + free shipping | Email + SMS |
| Lapsed | 2.5× cycle | Escalated offer | 20% off + bonus loyalty points | Email + SMS + push |
| Dormant | 3× cycle | Final attempt | 25% off or free product | Email + direct mail |
| Dormant | 3.5× cycle | Feedback request | "Help us improve" survey (no hard sell) | Email |
| Lost | 4× cycle | Sunset | Suppress from active campaigns; archive | System |

**KPI Targets**:
- At-risk save rate: 25%–35%
- Lapsed win-back rate: 10%–18%
- Dormant reactivation rate: 3%–8%

### Step 3 — Channel Strategy

Define channel orchestration rules:

**Email**: Primary lifecycle channel; used for all stages
- Frequency cap: 3–4 emails/week maximum
- Personalization: product history, name, preferences, browse behavior
- Best send times: Tuesday–Thursday, 9–11 AM and 7–9 PM local time

**SMS**: High-urgency, high-value moments
- Frequency cap: 4–6 SMS/month maximum
- Use for: reorder reminders, flash sales, shipping updates, win-back offers
- Always include opt-out; comply with TCPA
- Expected CTR: 15%–25% (significantly higher than email)

**Push Notifications**: Engagement and real-time triggers
- Use for: price drops on browsed items, back-in-stock, loyalty milestones
- Frequency cap: 1–2/day maximum
- Personalize with product imagery

**Direct Mail**: High-value moments and premium customers
- Use for: VIP welcome kits, dormant win-back (final attempt), holiday catalogs
- Cost: $2–$5/piece; reserve for LTV > $200 customers
- Expected response rate: 2%–5% (higher than digital for lapsed audiences)

### Step 4 — Offer Architecture

Structure offers to protect margin while driving action:

**Offer Hierarchy** (escalate only as needed):
1. Value-add (no margin impact): Free content, exclusive access, early launch
2. Shipping incentive: Free or expedited shipping ($5–$8 cost)
3. Points bonus: 2× or 3× loyalty points (deferred cost)
4. Percentage discount: 10% → 15% → 20% (escalating ladder)
5. Dollar-off: $10 off $50+ (protects AOV with minimum)
6. Free gift: GWP with purchase (inventory cost, perceived high value)
7. Bundle discount: 15% off curated bundle (AOV protective)

**Rules**:
- Never lead with maximum discount; always start with value-add
- Cap escalation at 25% off; beyond that, the customer is discount-dependent
- Track discount depth per customer; flag those requiring >15% to convert
- Exclude full-price loyal customers from discount flows (they don't need them)

### Step 5 — Measurement Framework

**Primary Retention KPIs**:

| Metric | Calculation | CPG Benchmark |
|---|---|---|
| 30-day repeat rate | Customers with 2+ orders in 30 days ÷ total customers | 15%–25% |
| 90-day repeat rate | Customers with 2+ orders in 90 days ÷ total | 25%–40% |
| Annual retention rate | Customers purchasing in Year 2 ÷ Year 1 customers | 30%–50% |
| Revenue retention rate | Revenue from retained customers ÷ prior year revenue | 80%–120% (net) |
| Cohort LTV curve | Cumulative revenue per customer by acquisition cohort | Category-dependent |

**Flow-Level KPIs**:
- Open rate, click rate, conversion rate per touchpoint
- Revenue attributed to each lifecycle flow
- Unsubscribe rate per flow (flag if >0.5% per send)
- Time-to-next-purchase after each flow trigger

## Output Specification

1. **Lifecycle Stage Map**: Visual stage definitions with transition criteria
2. **Stage Playbooks**: For each stage — trigger, flow, touchpoints, content, offers, channels, timing
3. **Channel Strategy**: Frequency caps, best practices, orchestration rules
4. **Offer Architecture**: Escalation ladder with margin impact estimates
5. **KPI Dashboard**: Retention metrics with benchmarks and targets
6. **Implementation Roadmap**: Phased rollout plan with priority ranking
7. **Tech Requirements**: ESP/CRM flow configurations, data triggers, integration needs

## Examples

**Input**: "Build a retention playbook for our DTC protein bar brand. Repurchase cycle is 21 days. Current repeat rate is 22% (goal: 35%). We use Klaviyo for email and Attentive for SMS."

**Output**: Complete 7-stage playbook with Klaviyo flow specifications. Post-purchase sequence with day 0–28 touchpoints driving 2nd purchase. Subscription push at day 14 with "never run out" messaging. Win-back ladder starting at day 42. Implementation roadmap: Phase 1 (weeks 1–2) — post-purchase welcome, Phase 2 (weeks 3–4) — reorder reminders, Phase 3 (weeks 5–6) — win-back flows. Projected repeat rate improvement from 22% to 32% within 90 days based on benchmarks.

**Input**: "Our skincare brand has high first-purchase-to-second drop-off (70% churn before order 2). Design a retention program focused on the first 60 days."

**Output**: Intensive first-60-day playbook with 12-touch post-purchase sequence. Day 1: order confirmation with routine-builder content. Day 3: ingredient education video. Day 7: "How's your skin feeling?" check-in with usage tips. Day 14: review request + before/after gallery. Day 21: personalized routine expansion recommendation. Day 30: subscribe & save with 15% off. Day 45: "Results take time" reassurance content. Day 60: reorder nudge with 10% off if no 2nd purchase. Projected: reduce 60-day churn from 70% to 55%.

## Guidelines

- The post-purchase-to-second-purchase window is the most critical retention moment; invest disproportionately here
- Different product categories require different timing — don't apply a one-size-fits-all cadence
- Always segment VIPs out of discount flows; they devalue the brand relationship for your best customers
- SMS is powerful but consent-dependent; never assume SMS opt-in
- Measure incrementality of retention programs, not just attributed revenue
- For subscription brands, retention playbook should include pause/skip optimization (not just cancel prevention)
- Direct mail has a resurgence in DTC — use it selectively for high-value moments
- Avoid over-communicating; respect frequency caps aggressively — unsubscribes are irreversible
- Test one variable at a time in lifecycle flows; multi-variable changes make attribution impossible
