# LTV Prediction

## Overview

This skill calculates and predicts Customer Lifetime Value (LTV/CLV) using multiple complementary methodologies — from simple historical averages to probabilistic BG/NBD and Gamma-Gamma models. It produces segment-level and cohort-level LTV estimates with confidence intervals, enabling data-driven decisions on customer acquisition budgets, retention investment, and marketing resource allocation.

## When to Use

- Setting customer acquisition cost (CAC) ceilings by channel or segment
- Evaluating the ROI of retention and loyalty programs
- Forecasting revenue from existing customer cohorts
- Prioritizing customer segments by predicted future value
- Building business cases for marketing investment
- Assessing LTV:CAC ratios to evaluate unit economics health
- Informing subscription pricing and discount strategy

## Required Inputs

|---|---|---|
| Transaction History | Yes | Customer-level: order date, order value, order count per customer |
| Customer Base Size | Yes | Total unique customers with at least one purchase |
| Analysis Period | Yes | Historical window (minimum 12 months; 24+ months preferred) |
| Prediction Horizon | Yes | Forward-looking period (12, 24, or 36 months) |
| Gross Margin | Recommended | Average gross margin % to calculate profit-based LTV |
| Acquisition Costs | Recommended | CAC by channel/segment for LTV:CAC ratio analysis |
| Discount Rate | No | Cost of capital for NPV-adjusted LTV (default: 10% annually) |
| Cohort Definitions | No | Monthly or quarterly acquisition cohorts for cohort analysis |
| Segment Labels | No | Pre-defined segments for segment-level LTV comparison |

## Methodology

### Step 1 — Historical LTV Calculation

Calculate observed LTV for baseline benchmarking:

**Simple Historical LTV**:
```
LTV(historical) = Average Revenue Per Customer over analysis period

LTV(historical) = Total Revenue ÷ Total Unique Customers
```

**Decomposed LTV Formula**:
```
LTV = AOV × Purchase Frequency × Customer Lifespan

Where:
  AOV = Total Revenue ÷ Total Orders
  Purchase Frequency = Total Orders ÷ Total Unique Customers
  Customer Lifespan = 1 ÷ Churn Rate (in years)
```

**Margin-Adjusted LTV**:
```
LTV(profit) = AOV × Gross Margin % × Purchase Frequency × Customer Lifespan
```

**NPV-Adjusted LTV** (accounts for time value of money):
```
LTV(npv) = Σ (Monthly Revenue × Gross Margin) ÷ (1 + d)^t
  for t = 1 to T months
  where d = monthly discount rate
```

### Step 2 — Cohort-Based LTV Analysis

Build a cohort retention and value matrix:

```
Cohort (Acquisition Month) → Track over months 1, 2, 3, ..., 12+

Metrics per cohort-month:
  - Retention Rate: % of cohort active in month N
  - Cumulative Revenue Per Customer: total spend through month N
  - Marginal Revenue: incremental revenue in month N
```

**Cohort LTV Curve Construction**:
1. Group customers by acquisition month (or quarter)
2. For each cohort, calculate cumulative revenue per customer at each time point
3. Plot LTV curves — earlier cohorts provide longer time series for extrapolation
4. Identify patterns: linear growth (subscription), logarithmic decay (one-time purchase heavy), or step-function (seasonal repurchase)

**Extrapolation Methods**:
- **Log-linear fit**: LTV(t) = a × ln(t) + b — works well for decelerating growth
- **Shifted geometric**: LTV(t) = a × (1 - r^t) / (1 - r) — models retention decay
- Use the most mature cohorts to parameterize the model; apply to newer cohorts

### Step 3 — RFM-Based LTV Scoring

Map RFM segments to LTV tiers using historical performance:

| RFM Segment | Avg Historical LTV | Predicted LTV Multiplier | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Champions (555) | $XXX | 1.2×–1.5× historical | High |
| Loyal (X45+) | $XXX | 1.0×–1.2× historical | High |
| Potential Loyalists (5X2–3) | $XX | 1.5×–2.5× historical | Medium |
| Recent (511) | $XX | 0.8×–3.0× historical | Low (wide range) |
| At Risk (1–2, 4–5, 4–5) | $XXX | 0.3×–0.5× historical | Medium |
| Hibernating (111–112) | $X | 0.0×–0.2× historical | High (near zero) |

Use RFM-LTV mapping for quick segment-level estimates when full modeling infrastructure is unavailable.

### Step 4 — Probabilistic Modeling (BG/NBD + Gamma-Gamma)

For advanced prediction, apply the **Buy-Till-You-Die** framework:

**BG/NBD Model** (predicts future transaction count):
- Inputs: frequency (repeat purchases), recency (time of last purchase), T (customer age)
- Outputs: P(alive) — probability customer is still active; E(X) — expected transactions in future period
- Assumptions: Purchases follow a Poisson process; dropout follows a beta-geometric distribution

**Gamma-Gamma Model** (predicts future transaction value):
- Inputs: frequency, average transaction value, population-level value distribution
- Outputs: E(M) — expected average transaction value for each customer
- Assumption: Transaction values are gamma-distributed and independent of frequency

**Combined LTV Prediction**:
```
Predicted LTV = E(X | BG/NBD) × E(M | Gamma-Gamma) × Gross Margin %

  Discounted:
  Predicted LTV(npv) = Σ [E(transactions in period t) × E(M) × margin] ÷ (1 + d)^t
```

**Model Validation**:
- Train on first 70% of time period; validate against held-out 30%
- Metric: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between predicted and actual customer-level spend
- Acceptable MAE: <25% of average LTV for CPG/retail
- Also validate P(alive) calibration: predicted alive probabilities should match observed reactivation rates

### Step 5 — LTV:CAC Ratio Analysis

Calculate unit economics health by channel and segment:

```
LTV:CAC Ratio = Predicted LTV ÷ Customer Acquisition Cost

Interpretation:
  < 1.0  → Unprofitable; losing money on acquisition
  1.0–2.0 → Marginal; requires high retention to break even
  2.0–3.0 → Healthy; typical target for DTC CPG brands
  3.0–5.0 → Strong; room to increase acquisition spend
  > 5.0  → Potentially under-investing in growth
```

**Payback Period**:
```
Payback Period = CAC ÷ (Monthly Revenue Per Customer × Gross Margin %)

CPG Benchmarks:
  Subscription CPG: 3–6 months payback
  Non-subscription DTC: 6–12 months payback
  Marketplace-dependent: 2–4 months payback (lower CAC, lower LTV)
```

### Step 6 — Sensitivity Analysis & Scenarios

Model LTV under different retention and AOV assumptions:

| Scenario | Retention Rate | AOV | Frequency | Predicted 24mo LTV |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Base Case | Current | Current | Current | $XXX |
| Retention +10% | +10pp | Current | Current | $XXX (+XX%) |
| AOV +15% | Current | +15% | Current | $XXX (+XX%) |
| Frequency +1 order | Current | Current | +1/year | $XXX (+XX%) |
| Combined Upside | +10pp | +10% | +0.5/year | $XXX (+XX%) |
| Downside | -10pp | -5% | Current | $XXX (-XX%) |

Identify which lever (retention, AOV, frequency) has the greatest LTV impact — this prioritizes marketing strategy.

### Step 7 — Segment-Level LTV Summary

Produce a summary table:

```
Segment       | Customers | Avg LTV(12mo) | Avg LTV(24mo) | LTV:CAC | Payback | Priority
Champions     | X,XXX     | $XXX          | $XXX          | X.X     | X mo    | Retain
Loyal         | X,XXX     | $XXX          | $XXX          | X.X     | X mo    | Grow
Pot. Loyalists| X,XXX     | $XX           | $XXX          | X.X     | X mo    | Convert
New           | X,XXX     | $XX           | $XX–$XXX      | X.X     | X mo    | Nurture
At Risk       | X,XXX     | $XXX          | $XX           | N/A     | N/A     | Win-back
```

## Examples

**Input**: "Calculate LTV for our DTC coffee subscription brand. 30,000 customers, 24 months of data, $35 AOV, 65% gross margin. We spend $40 CAC on Meta and $25 on Google."

**Output**: Historical 12-month LTV of $142; predicted 24-month LTV of $198 (BG/NBD + Gamma-Gamma). LTV:CAC of 3.5× for Meta, 5.7× for Google — recommend shifting 15% of Meta budget to Google. Cohort analysis shows LTV curves plateau at month 18 for non-subscribers vs. continuous growth for subscribers. Key lever: converting one-time buyers to subscription (+$85 incremental LTV). Sensitivity: +10pp retention increases 24mo LTV by 28%.

**Input**: "We need LTV estimates per customer segment for our beauty e-commerce brand to set acquisition budgets for next year."

**Output**: Segment-level 12-month predicted LTV ranging from $28 (one-time discount buyers) to $340 (VIP multi-category buyers). Recommendation: set Meta CPA cap at $45 for VIP-likely audiences (LTV:CAC 7.5×) and $15 for deal-seeker audiences (LTV:CAC 1.9×). Cohort analysis shows Q4-acquired customers have 20% lower LTV due to promotion-driven acquisition.

## Guidelines

- Always calculate both revenue-based and profit-based (margin-adjusted) LTV
- Minimum 12 months of data required; flag low-confidence predictions for businesses <12 months old
- Exclude outlier transactions (>99th percentile order value) to prevent skewed averages
- For subscription businesses, separate subscriber vs. non-subscriber LTV — they have fundamentally different curves
- Discount-heavy acquisition cohorts typically show 15–30% lower LTV; flag this in analysis
- NPV discounting is critical for long prediction horizons (>12 months)
- Always present confidence intervals, not point estimates, for predicted LTV
- BG/NBD assumes non-contractual settings (customer can leave silently); use different models for subscription/contractual
- Validate model predictions against holdout data before using for budget decisions
- Seasonal CPG categories (sunscreen, cold remedies) need seasonality-adjusted frequency estimates
