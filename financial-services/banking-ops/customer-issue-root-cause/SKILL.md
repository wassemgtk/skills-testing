# Customer Issue Root Cause Analysis

## Overview

This skill produces structured root cause analyses for banking customer complaints and operational issues. It applies systematic RCA methodologies (Five Whys, Fishbone/Ishikawa, fault tree analysis) to identify systemic causes of service failures, processing errors, and customer dissatisfaction. Output supports complaint resolution, process improvement, UDAAP risk mitigation, and regulatory complaint management requirements.

## When to Use

- Investigating the root cause of customer complaints escalated to management
- Analyzing patterns in recurring operational errors or service failures
- Supporting CFPB or state regulator complaint response requirements
- Identifying systemic issues from complaint trend analysis
- Documenting RCA for executive complaint resolution reports
- Feeding findings into Six Sigma or Lean process improvement initiatives
- Assessing UDAAP risk from complaint patterns

## Required Inputs

| Input | Description | Format |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Complaint details | Customer complaint narrative, category, severity | Complaint record |
| Account/transaction data | Related account and transaction information | System extracts |
| Process documentation | SOPs, policies, workflows for the affected area | Procedure documents |
| System logs | Application logs, audit trails, error codes | Technical logs |
| Historical complaints | Similar complaints from the past 12 months | Complaint database |
| Staff interviews | Input from involved employees | Interview notes |
| Regulatory context | Applicable regulations (Reg E, Reg CC, UDAAP, FCRA) | Regulatory mapping |

## Methodology

### Step 1: Define the Problem Statement

Craft a precise problem statement using the 5W1H framework:

| Element | Question | Answer |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **What** | What went wrong? | [Specific failure or error] |
| **Who** | Who is affected? | [Customer segment, volume of affected customers] |
| **When** | When did it occur/start? | [Date/time, duration] |
| **Where** | Where in the process did it fail? | [Process step, system, channel] |
| **Why** | Why is it a problem? | [Customer impact, financial impact, regulatory risk] |
| **How** | How was it detected? | [Customer report, internal monitoring, audit] |

**Problem statement template**: "[What] occurred affecting [Who] starting [When] in the [Where] process, resulting in [impact]. The issue was detected via [How]."

### Step 2: Gather and Verify Facts

Collect evidence from multiple sources to avoid bias:

1. **Customer perspective**: Complaint narrative, interaction history, stated expectations
2. **Transaction/system data**: Actual transaction records, system timestamps, error codes
3. **Process execution**: What steps were followed vs. what the SOP prescribes
4. **Staff perspective**: Employee account of what happened and why
5. **Control evidence**: Whether preventive and detective controls functioned
6. **Regulatory timeline**: Applicable response deadlines and compliance requirements

Cross-reference sources to identify discrepancies and establish the factual timeline.

### Step 3: Apply Root Cause Analysis Framework

Use appropriate RCA methodology based on complexity:

**Five Whys** (for straightforward issues):
1. Why did [problem] occur? → [Direct cause]
2. Why did [direct cause] happen? → [Contributing factor]
3. Why did [contributing factor] exist? → [Process gap]
4. Why wasn't [process gap] caught? → [Control failure]
5. Why did [control] fail? → [Root cause]

**Fishbone (Ishikawa) Diagram** (for complex, multi-factor issues):

| Category | Potential Causes |
|----------|-----------------|
| **People** | Training gaps, staffing levels, skill mismatches, turnover |
| **Process** | Procedure gaps, handoff failures, exception handling |
| **Policy** | Outdated policy, ambiguous guidance, conflicting rules |
| **Technology** | System errors, integration failures, data quality |
| **Communication** | Customer miscommunication, internal miscommunication |
| **External** | Vendor failures, regulatory changes, customer behavior |

**Fault Tree Analysis** (for high-severity or recurring issues):
- Start with the undesired event (top event)
- Decompose into intermediate events using AND/OR logic gates
- Identify the minimal cut sets (combinations of basic events that cause the top event)
- Prioritize based on probability and impact

### Step 4: Assess Customer Impact

Quantify the impact across dimensions:

| Impact Dimension | Assessment | Metric |
|------------------|------------|--------|
| Financial harm | Direct monetary loss to customer | [$Amount per customer] |
| Inconvenience | Time, effort, disruption to customer | [Hours, interactions required] |
| Breadth | Number of customers affected | [Count and % of base] |
| Duration | How long the issue persisted | [Days/weeks] |
| Vulnerability | Were vulnerable populations disproportionately affected? | [Yes/No, details] |
| Reputation | Social media, press, or viral complaint risk | [Low/Medium/High] |

### Step 5: Evaluate Regulatory Risk

Assess the complaint against regulatory frameworks:

**UDAAP Analysis** (Unfair, Deceptive, Abusive Acts or Practices):
- **Unfair**: Does the practice cause substantial injury not reasonably avoidable by consumers, not outweighed by benefits?
- **Deceptive**: Was there a material misrepresentation or omission likely to mislead a reasonable consumer?
- **Abusive**: Did the practice take unreasonable advantage of consumer's lack of understanding, inability to protect their interests, or reasonable reliance on the institution?

**Regulation-Specific Assessment**:
- Reg E: Electronic fund transfer rights and error resolution
- Reg CC: Funds availability and check hold policies
- Reg DD: Truth in Savings disclosure accuracy
- Reg Z: Truth in Lending disclosure and billing error rights
- FCRA: Credit reporting accuracy and dispute rights
- SCRA: Servicemembers Civil Relief Act protections

### Step 6: Identify Systemic Patterns

Look beyond the individual complaint to identify systemic issues:

- **Volume analysis**: How many similar complaints in the past 12 months?
- **Trend analysis**: Is the complaint rate increasing, stable, or decreasing?
- **Cluster analysis**: Are complaints concentrated in specific branches, channels, or products?
- **Timing analysis**: Do complaints correlate with system changes, policy updates, or staffing changes?
- **Demographic analysis**: Are certain customer segments disproportionately affected?

### Step 7: Develop and Document Recommendations

Structure recommendations by category:

**Immediate remediation** (0-30 days):
- Customer-specific resolution (refund, correction, apology)
- Interim process changes to prevent recurrence
- Communication to affected customers if broader impact identified

**Short-term fixes** (30-90 days):
- Process redesign for the affected workflow
- System configuration changes or defect fixes
- Staff retraining on corrected procedures
- Enhanced monitoring for the affected area

**Long-term improvements** (90-365 days):
- Policy or procedure rewrite
- Technology solution for error prevention
- Organizational or staffing changes
- Customer experience redesign

## Analysis Framework

### Complaint Categorization Taxonomy

Classify complaints for pattern analysis:
- **Account services**: Opening/closing, maintenance, access, statements
- **Transactions**: Posting errors, holds, delays, unauthorized activity
- **Fees**: Overdraft, maintenance, ATM, wire, early closure
- **Lending**: Application, servicing, payoff, escrow, rate
- **Digital banking**: Mobile app, online banking, bill pay, transfers
- **Customer service**: Wait times, staff behavior, resolution quality

### UDAAP Risk Matrix

| Likelihood | Low Impact | Medium Impact | High Impact |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| **High** (frequent complaints) | Monitor | Remediate | Escalate immediately |
| **Medium** (periodic complaints) | Track | Investigate | Remediate |
| **Low** (isolated complaint) | Document | Monitor | Investigate |

## Examples

**Example 1 — Fee Complaint RCA**:
"Problem: Customer charged $175 in overdraft fees (5 x $35) on 2025-08-15 for transactions totaling $47.32. Customer states she had sufficient funds. Five Whys: (1) Why were fees charged? Five transactions posted against insufficient funds. (2) Why were funds insufficient? A $1,200 mobile deposit was placed on extended hold. (3) Why was an extended hold placed? The deposit exceeded the $225 next-day availability threshold and the account was <30 days old (Reg CC exception). (4) Why wasn't the customer notified of the hold? The mobile deposit flow does not display hold duration for new accounts. (5) Root cause: Mobile deposit user experience does not communicate Reg CC hold policies for new accounts, creating a gap between customer expectation and actual funds availability. UDAAP risk: Medium — while the hold is permitted under Reg CC, the failure to clearly communicate availability timing could be considered deceptive. Recommendation: Update mobile deposit confirmation screen to display expected availability date and amount for all deposits subject to holds."

**Example 2 — Systemic Pattern RCA**:
"Analysis of 847 complaints received in Q3 2025 categorized as 'transaction posting error' reveals a 340% increase from Q2. Cluster analysis shows 78% originated from customers using the mobile bill pay feature launched June 2025. Root cause: a system defect causes duplicate payment submissions when users tap the 'Pay' button during processing latency >3 seconds. The defect was introduced in the v4.2 mobile app release (06/01/2025). Customer impact: 1,247 customers affected, $892K in duplicate payments, $43K in overdraft fees. Immediate action: Deploy hotfix to disable duplicate button press (v4.2.1, released 09/25/2025). Remediation: Refund all overdraft fees caused by duplicate payments ($43K); reverse duplicate payments still in processing ($218K). Long-term: Implement idempotency controls in all payment APIs to prevent duplicate submission regardless of UI behavior."

## Guidelines

- Begin every RCA with verified facts, not assumptions or customer allegations alone
- Root cause must be systemic (process, policy, technology, training); individual blame is not an RCA outcome
- Always assess UDAAP risk for consumer complaints, even when the practice is technically compliant
- Document both the root cause and contributing factors; most issues have multiple contributors
- Quantify customer impact in both individual and aggregate terms
- Check for patterns before assuming a complaint is isolated
- Reg E disputes have specific timeline requirements; document compliance in every applicable case
- Recommendations must be actionable with specific owners and deadlines
- Track recommendation implementation to closure and measure effectiveness
- Preserve RCA documentation for 5 years (regulatory examination and legal discovery retention)
