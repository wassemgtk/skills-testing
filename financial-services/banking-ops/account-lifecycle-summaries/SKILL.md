# Account Lifecycle Summaries

## Overview

This skill produces structured, end-to-end narratives of customer account lifecycles for banking operations. It covers account opening, product utilization, service interactions, account modifications, dispute history, fee assessment, and closure events. Output supports relationship management, dispute resolution, regulatory response, legal discovery, and customer retention analysis.

## When to Use

- Preparing account histories for customer complaints or regulatory inquiries
- Creating relationship summaries for retention or cross-sell analysis
- Supporting legal discovery or subpoena responses with account timelines
- Investigating account activity patterns for BSA/AML or fraud reviews
- Documenting account closure circumstances and final disposition
- Preparing materials for customer escalations or executive complaints
- Supporting Reg E or Reg CC dispute investigation timelines

## Required Inputs

| Input | Description | Format |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Account data | Account number, type, open date, status | Core system extract |
| Transaction history | Full transaction ledger for the account | Transaction file |
| Service interactions | Call logs, branch visits, digital sessions, complaints | CRM/interaction records |
| Product changes | Upgrades, downgrades, rate changes, feature modifications | Product history |
| Fee history | Fees assessed, reversed, waived with reasons | Fee ledger |
| Dispute history | Claims filed, provisional credits, resolutions | Dispute system |
| Closure details | Closure date, reason, final balance disposition | Account records |

## Methodology

### Step 1: Establish Account Context

Build the foundational profile:

- **Account type and product**: Checking, savings, CD, money market, loan, credit card, LOC
- **Opening channel**: Branch, online, mobile, call center, referral
- **Opening date and circumstances**: Promotion, relationship expansion, new-to-bank
- **Initial funding**: Source and amount of initial deposit or credit line
- **Account ownership**: Individual, joint, UTMA, trust, business, estate
- **Associated accounts**: Related accounts in the household or entity relationship
- **Account features**: Overdraft protection, direct deposit, automatic payments, linked accounts

### Step 2: Map the Activity Timeline

Create a chronological narrative organized by lifecycle phase:

**Phase 1 — Onboarding (0-90 days)**:
- Account funding pattern (how quickly was the account funded?)
- Product activation (debit card activation, online enrollment, direct deposit setup)
- Initial transaction patterns establishing baseline behavior
- Early attrition indicators (low activity, funding shortfall)

**Phase 2 — Active Usage (ongoing)**:
- Average monthly balance trajectory (growing, stable, declining)
- Transaction volume and mix (debits, credits, ACH, wires, checks, POS)
- Product deepening events (new products added to relationship)
- Service channel usage patterns (branch, digital, ATM, call center)
- Fee patterns (overdraft frequency, maintenance fee assessment/waiver)

**Phase 3 — Relationship Changes**:
- Product modifications (upgrades, downgrades, feature changes)
- Rate changes and repricing events
- Address or contact information changes
- Ownership changes (add/remove signers, beneficiary updates)
- Risk rating changes

**Phase 4 — Distress Signals (if applicable)**:
- Balance decline trajectory and acceleration
- Overdraft frequency increase
- Return item patterns (NSF)
- Collection activity on linked loan products
- Service complaint escalation
- Delinquency progression

**Phase 5 — Closure**:
- Closure date and method (customer-initiated, bank-initiated, inactivity)
- Reason for closure (customer stated reason, bank documented reason)
- Final balance disposition (check issued, transfer, escheatment)
- Outstanding items at closure (pending transactions, holds, disputes)
- Post-closure activity (returned items, incoming deposits, tax reporting)

### Step 3: Analyze Service Interactions

Summarize the customer service history:

| Date | Channel | Type | Summary | Resolution | Sentiment |
|------|---------|------|---------|------------|-----------|
| [Date] | [Channel] | [Inquiry/Complaint/Request] | [Brief summary] | [Resolution] | [Positive/Neutral/Negative] |

Calculate service metrics:
- Total interactions over account life
- Complaint frequency and escalation rate
- Average resolution time
- Channel preference distribution
- Net sentiment trajectory (improving, stable, deteriorating)

### Step 4: Document Fee and Pricing History

Provide a comprehensive fee narrative:
- Total fees assessed over account life by fee type
- Fee waivers and reversals with documented reasons
- Net fee revenue from the account
- Fee-related complaints and their outcomes
- Comparison to product fee schedule and any exceptions granted
- Pricing changes (rate adjustments, fee schedule changes) and their timing

### Step 5: Summarize Dispute History

For accounts with Reg E or Reg CC disputes:

| Dispute # | Date Filed | Type | Amount | Provisional Credit | Final Resolution | Timeline Compliance |
|-----------|-----------|------|--------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| [#] | [Date] | [Type] | [$Amount] | [Date/Amount] | [Outcome] | [Yes/No] |

Document Reg E compliance:
- Was provisional credit issued within 10 business days (20 for new accounts)?
- Was the investigation completed within 45 days (90 for certain transactions)?
- Was the customer notified of the outcome in writing within 3 business days?
- If provisional credit was reversed, was proper notice given?

### Step 6: Calculate Relationship Economics

Assess the account's financial contribution:

| Metric | Value | Benchmark |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Average monthly balance | [$X] | [$X peer average] |
| Net interest margin contribution | [$X/year] | |
| Fee revenue (gross) | [$X/year] | |
| Fee waivers/reversals | -[$X/year] | |
| Service cost (estimated) | -[$X/year] | |
| Net relationship value | [$X/year] | |
| Lifetime value (total) | [$X] | |

### Step 7: Produce the Narrative Summary

Synthesize all elements into a cohesive account story:

- Focus on material events and inflection points
- Highlight patterns and trends rather than exhaustive detail
- Note regulatory compliance touchpoints (Reg E, Reg CC, UDAAP)
- Identify lessons learned for process improvement
- Recommend follow-up actions if the account is still active

## Analysis Framework

### Attrition Risk Indicators

When analyzing active accounts for retention:
- Balance decline >25% over 3 consecutive months
- Direct deposit removal or reduction
- Debit card usage decline >50%
- Multiple fee complaints in 90-day window
- Digital banking login frequency drop >40%
- Competitor ACH credits appearing (new account funding elsewhere)

### Complaint Pattern Analysis

Categorize complaints for systemic identification:
- Product-related (fee disputes, feature limitations)
- Service-related (wait times, resolution quality, channel access)
- Error-related (posting errors, system issues, misapplied payments)
- Policy-related (hold policies, overdraft practices, closure policies)

## Examples

**Example 1 — Closed Account Summary**:
"Account #XXXX4477 (Premium Checking) was opened 2022-06-15 at the Main Street branch with an initial deposit of $5,000 via cashier's check. Direct deposit of $6,200/month was established within 30 days, waiving the $25 monthly maintenance fee. The account maintained an average balance of $8,400 through Q2 2024. Beginning July 2024, the balance declined to $2,100 as the customer's direct deposit shifted to a competitor. Seven overdraft fees ($35 each, $245 total) were assessed in Q4 2024; four were reversed following customer calls. The customer filed a complaint on 01/10/2025 regarding overdraft practices, which was escalated to the branch manager. The account was closed customer-initiated on 01/22/2025 with a final balance of $847 disbursed by official check. Lifetime relationship value: $1,840 in net revenue over 31 months."

**Example 2 — Regulatory Response Summary**:
"Per CFPB inquiry #2025-XXXX, the following account history is provided for account #XXXX8893 (consumer checking, individual ownership). The account was opened 2023-01-09 via online application. Consumer filed a Reg E dispute on 2024-11-15 for an unauthorized ACH debit of $1,200.00. Provisional credit of $1,200.00 was issued on 2024-11-19 (business day 2, within 10-business-day requirement). Investigation completed 2024-12-20 (business day 25, within 45-calendar-day requirement). Finding: claim denied, unauthorized transaction not substantiated based on IP address and device matching customer's enrolled device. Provisional credit reversed 2024-12-23 with written notice mailed 2024-12-20 (within 3-business-day requirement). All Reg E timeline requirements were satisfied."
