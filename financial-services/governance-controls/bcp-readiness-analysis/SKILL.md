# Business Continuity Planning Readiness Analysis

## Overview

Assess business continuity planning (BCP) readiness across financial institution operations, technology, and third-party ecosystems. This skill applies the FFIEC Business Continuity Planning Handbook, OCC Heightened Standards (12 CFR 30 Appendix D), and NIST SP 800-34 (Contingency Planning Guide) to evaluate BCP program maturity, business impact analysis completeness, recovery strategy adequacy, and testing program effectiveness.

## When to Use

- Assessing overall BCP program maturity and examination readiness
- Evaluating business impact analysis (BIA) completeness and currency
- Reviewing IT disaster recovery plans and testing results
- Assessing pandemic, cyber resilience, and work-from-home continuity plans
- Preparing for FFIEC or OCC examinations focused on business continuity
- Evaluating third-party BCP capabilities for critical vendors

## Required Inputs

- **BCP program documentation**: BCP policy, program charter, governance structure, plan maintenance schedule
- **Business impact analyses**: BIA results by business unit, criticality tiers, RTO/RPO definitions
- **Recovery plans**: Business unit recovery plans, IT disaster recovery plans, crisis communication plans
- **Testing results**: Test schedules, exercise results, action item tracking, lessons learned
- **Third-party BCP**: Critical vendor BCP assessments, contractual BCP requirements
- **Incident history**: Prior activations, near-misses, pandemic response experience

## Methodology

### Step 1: BCP Governance and Program Assessment

Evaluate the BCP governance framework against FFIEC Handbook expectations:

- Board has approved BCP policy and receives regular program reporting
- Senior management has designated a BCP program owner with authority and resources
- BCP responsibilities are integrated into business line management accountability
- Policy defines scope, objectives, roles, and addresses FFIEC/OCC requirements
- Standards address minimum BIA requirements, testing frequency, and maintenance cycles

Assess all FFIEC program elements: Business Impact Analysis, Risk Assessment, Recovery Strategies, Plan Development, Testing, Maintenance, and Training/Awareness.

### Step 2: Business Impact Analysis (BIA) Evaluation

Assess the quality and completeness of the institution's BIA:

- **Scope**: All business functions and critical processes included
- **Criticality classification**: Clear tiering (Critical, Essential, Important, Non-Essential) with defined criteria
- **Recovery objectives**: RTO and RPO defined based on business impact, not technology capability
- **Dependencies**: Upstream and downstream process dependencies mapped
- **Resource requirements**: Minimum staffing, technology, facilities, and data specified
- **Financial impact**: Revenue loss, penalties, and reputational damage quantified at progressive intervals
- **Peak periods**: Seasonal dependencies identified (month-end, quarter-end, tax season)
- **Currency**: Updated within 12 months and validated by business owners

BIA quality scoring: Completeness of scope (20%), RTO/RPO appropriateness (25%), Dependency mapping (20%), Financial impact analysis (15%), Currency and validation (20%).

### Step 3: Recovery Strategy Assessment

Evaluate whether recovery strategies meet BIA-defined objectives across four dimensions:

**Technology**: Backup strategy (frequency, offsite, encryption), data replication (sync/async, RPO alignment), alternate processing (hot/warm/cold/cloud), network redundancy, application recovery sequencing.

**Business Operations**: Alternate work locations, remote work capacity, manual workaround procedures, vital records management.

**People and Communication**: Crisis management team with succession, mass notification system, customer communication templates, regulatory notification procedures with defined triggers.

**Third-Party**: Critical vendor BCP capabilities assessed, contractual BCP provisions, alternate vendor arrangements, fourth-party dependencies understood.

### Step 4: Testing Program Effectiveness Review

Assess the BCP testing program against FFIEC expectations:

| Plan Type | Minimum Frequency | Progressive Complexity |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Enterprise crisis management | Annually | Tabletop → Simulation |
| IT disaster recovery | Semi-annually | Walkthrough → Failover |
| Business unit recovery | Annually | Checklist → Functional |
| Communication/notification | Quarterly | Call tree → Full notification |

Tests must use realistic scenarios, define measurable objectives and success criteria, validate actual RTO/RPO achievement, include cross-functional dependencies, and formally document results with gap action items tracked to remediation.

### Step 5: Cyber Resilience Integration

Assess BCP and cybersecurity integration per FFIEC and NIST CSF: cyber scenarios in BCP testing (ransomware, data destruction), recovery plans for compromised backups, immutable backup strategies, coordinated incident response and BCP escalation, evidence preservation procedures, and breach notification requirements.

### Step 6: Pandemic and Extended Disruption Readiness

Evaluate preparedness for prolonged disruptions: remote work infrastructure for sustained (>30 day) operations, essential function staffing with geographic distribution and cross-training, supply chain continuity, customer service resilience, employee health protocols, and integration of prior pandemic lessons learned.

### Step 7: Readiness Scoring and Remediation Planning

Score each BCP component against a maturity model, identify gaps between readiness and regulatory expectations, prioritize remediation by risk exposure and regulatory urgency, develop a multi-year maturity roadmap, and prepare examination-ready evidence packages.

## Analysis Framework

BCP maturity model aligned with FFIEC expectations:

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 — Initial | Informal plans, no structured program, limited testing |
| 2 — Developing | BIA completed, basic plans documented, annual testing initiated |
| 3 — Defined | Comprehensive program with governance, regular testing, maintenance cycle |
| 4 — Managed | Integrated program with metrics, progressive testing, continuous improvement |
| 5 — Optimized | Resilience-focused, real-time monitoring, adaptive planning, industry-leading |

## Examples

**Example 1 — RTO/RPO Gap Finding**:
"The Commercial Lending division's BIA defines a 4-hour RTO for the loan origination system. IT DR testing demonstrated a 14-hour recovery time (8hr database restore + 4hr reconfiguration + 2hr reconciliation). The RPO of 24 hours (daily backup) also exceeds the BIA-defined 4-hour RPO. Recommend: implement database replication (reducing RPO to <1hr and RTO to <2hrs), estimated $350K with 6-month implementation."

**Example 2 — Testing Program Deficiency**:
"The institution has not performed a full functional recovery test of the core banking platform in 28 months. The last payments DR failover (18 months ago) failed to restore within RTO — the remediation action item remains open. Per FFIEC BCP Handbook, testing should demonstrate recovery within established timeframes. Recommend: (1) conduct DR failover for core banking and payments within 60 days, (2) resolve open failed-test action items immediately, (3) establish semi-annual DR testing for all Tier 1 systems."

## Guidelines

- Assess BCP holistically, not just at the technology disaster recovery level
- BIA-defined RTOs/RPOs should drive recovery strategy investment, not the reverse
- Testing is the most critical element; untested plans provide false confidence
- Consider interdependencies between business units during recovery
- Integrate pandemic and cyber resilience into the core BCP program
- Third-party BCP assessment is a regulatory expectation, not optional
