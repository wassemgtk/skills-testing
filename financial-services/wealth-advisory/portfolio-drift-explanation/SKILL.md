# Portfolio Drift Explanation

## Overview

Generate clear, client-appropriate explanations of how and why a portfolio has drifted from its target allocation. This skill decomposes drift into market-driven and cash-flow-driven components, explains the risk implications of the drift, and presents rebalancing options with trade-off analysis. Explanations are designed for client-facing communication — plain language with visual-ready data that advisors can use in review meetings.

## When to Use

- Quarterly or annual client review meetings to explain allocation changes
- When drift has triggered rebalancing thresholds requiring client notification
- Client inquiries about why their portfolio "looks different" from what was agreed
- Preparing rebalancing proposals with clear rationale for recommended trades
- Explaining the risk impact of allowing drift to continue vs. rebalancing
- Documenting fiduciary decision-making around drift management

## Required Inputs

| Input | Description | Format |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Target allocation | IPS or planning-defined target weights | Allocation model |
| Current allocation | Actual portfolio weights by asset class | Current holdings |
| Historical allocation | Allocation snapshots over trailing periods | Time series |
| Market returns | Asset class returns over the drift period | Return data |
| Cash flows | Contributions, withdrawals, distributions | Transaction history |
| Risk metrics | Portfolio risk before and after drift | Risk analytics |
| Rebalancing bands | IPS-defined tolerance ranges per asset class | Policy parameters |

## Methodology

### Step 1 — Drift Quantification

Calculate the precise drift for each asset class:

| Asset Class | Target | Current | Drift | Band | Status |
|-------------|--------|---------|-------|------|--------|
| US Equity | 40.0% | 44.8% | +4.8% | ±5% | Approaching limit |
| Int'l Equity | 15.0% | 16.2% | +1.2% | ±3% | Within band |
| Fixed Income | 30.0% | 25.6% | -4.4% | ±5% | Approaching limit |
| Alternatives | 10.0% | 9.8% | -0.2% | ±3% | Within band |
| Cash | 5.0% | 3.6% | -1.4% | ±2% | Within band |

Calculate aggregate drift measures:
- **Sum of absolute deviations**: Total portfolio drift magnitude
- **Tracking error vs. target**: Expected return difference from target portfolio
- **Risk budget utilization**: Current portfolio risk vs. target risk budget

### Step 2 — Drift Decomposition

Separate drift into its component causes:

**Market-driven drift:**
- Calculate the hypothetical allocation assuming no cash flows (pure market returns applied to starting weights)
- Compare to actual allocation to isolate market effect
- Example: "US equities returned 18% while bonds returned 3% over the past year, naturally increasing equity weight"

**Cash-flow-driven drift:**
- Calculate the allocation change attributable to contributions, withdrawals, and income reinvestment
- Common patterns: Regular withdrawals from fixed income reducing FI weight; contributions invested in cash pending deployment
- Example: "Your monthly $5,000 distribution was funded from bonds, reducing fixed income weight by 1.2%"

**Rebalancing lag drift:**
- Time elapsed since last rebalancing event
- Cumulative drift that would have been corrected by more frequent rebalancing

**Drift attribution formula:**
Total Drift = Market Effect + Cash Flow Effect + Rebalancing Lag Effect

### Step 3 — Risk Impact Assessment

Quantify how drift has changed the portfolio's risk characteristics:

- **Volatility change**: Portfolio standard deviation at target vs. current allocation
  - Example: "Your portfolio's expected volatility has increased from 10.2% to 11.4% due to higher equity weight"
- **Maximum drawdown exposure**: Expected worst-case loss at target vs. current
  - Example: "In a 2008-like scenario, your portfolio would now decline an estimated 32% vs. 27% at target weights"
- **Income impact**: Change in expected portfolio income yield
- **Sharpe ratio comparison**: Risk-adjusted return at target vs. current allocation
- **Downside risk**: Value-at-Risk (VaR) or Conditional VaR at both allocations
- **Correlation shift**: How drift has changed the portfolio's diversification benefit

Present risk impacts in client-friendly terms: "The drift has modestly increased your portfolio's risk. In a market downturn similar to 2020, your portfolio would experience approximately $X more in temporary losses than at target weights."

### Step 4 — Scenario Analysis

Show forward-looking implications of rebalancing vs. staying drifted:

**Scenario 1 — Rebalance now:**
- Return to target allocation, realize the risk/return profile originally agreed
- Tax cost of rebalancing (estimated gains/losses from selling over-weighted positions)
- Transaction costs

**Scenario 2 — Partial rebalance:**
- Bring most over-weight positions back to range maximum (not target)
- Reduces tax impact while addressing largest deviations
- Maintains some market momentum benefit

**Scenario 3 — No action (continue drift):**
- If market trends continue, projected allocation in 3/6/12 months
- Risk metrics at projected future allocation
- Probability of breaching IPS bands within the next quarter

### Step 5 — Client-Friendly Narrative Construction

Translate the technical analysis into a clear client narrative:

**Structure:**
1. **What happened**: "Over the past [period], your portfolio's mix has shifted because [primary reason]"
2. **Why it happened**: "Stock markets gained [X%] while bonds returned [X%], which naturally pushed your equity allocation higher"
3. **What it means**: "This means your portfolio is taking slightly [more/less] risk than we originally planned"
4. **What we recommend**: "We recommend [action] to bring your portfolio back in line with your investment plan"
5. **Trade-offs**: "This will involve [costs/taxes/considerations], which we believe is outweighed by [benefit]"

Avoid jargon: Use "stock portion" instead of "equity allocation," "bonds" instead of "fixed income," "mix" instead of "allocation."

### Step 6 — Rebalancing Recommendation

Present specific rebalancing recommendations with tax analysis:

- List specific trades needed to return to target or range
- Estimate tax impact: short-term gains, long-term gains, harvestable losses
- Consider tax-loss harvesting opportunities created by rebalancing
- Evaluate using new contributions to rebalance passively (cash flow rebalancing)
- For retirement accounts: Rebalance first in tax-deferred accounts (no tax impact)
- Provide net-of-tax benefit analysis of rebalancing vs. not rebalancing

### Step 7 — Documentation and Next Steps

Document the drift analysis and decision for compliance records:

## Output Specification

```
## Portfolio Drift Report — [Client Name]

### Summary
Your portfolio has drifted from its target allocation over the past [period].
The primary driver was [market returns / cash flows / both].

### Allocation Comparison
| Asset Class | Target | Current | Drift | Action Needed |
|-------------|--------|---------|-------|---------------|
| Stocks (US) | XX% | XX.X% | +X.X% | [Reduce/None] |
| Stocks (Int'l) | XX% | XX.X% | +/-X.X% | [Reduce/Add/None] |
| Bonds | XX% | XX.X% | -X.X% | [Add/None] |
| Alternatives | XX% | XX.X% | +/-X.X% | [Adjust/None] |
| Cash | XX% | XX.X% | +/-X.X% | [Deploy/None] |

## Analysis Framework

Apply the **DRIP** framework:

- **D**rift — Quantify the deviation from target for every asset class
- **R**eason — Decompose drift into market, cash flow, and timing components
- **I**mpact — Assess risk and return implications of the drift
- **P**lan — Present actionable rebalancing options with trade-off analysis

## Examples

**Example 1 — Post-Rally Equity Drift**

Client with 60/40 target. After a 25% equity rally, portfolio is now 68/32. Drift explanation: "Over the past 12 months, the stock market rose significantly — about 25% — while your bonds earned about 4%. This strong stock performance naturally increased your stock portion from 60% to 68%. While this extra growth is good news, it means your portfolio is now taking about 15% more risk than we planned. We recommend selling about $85,000 of stock funds and purchasing bonds to bring you back to 60/40. This would generate approximately $12,000 in long-term capital gains ($2,400 in taxes at your rate), but it restores the risk level we agreed is right for your situation."

**Example 2 — Withdrawal-Driven Drift**

Retired client taking $8,000/month distributions funded from bond ladder. Target: 50/50. Current: 56/44 after 18 months. Drift explanation: "Your monthly income distributions have been coming from your bond investments as planned, but over 18 months this has gradually reduced your bond portion from 50% to 44%. We recommend redirecting the next 3 months of distributions from your stock account and making a one-time $45,000 exchange from stocks to bonds in your IRA (no tax impact) to restore your 50/50 balance."

## Guidelines

- Use plain language throughout — this is a client-facing document
- Quantify risk impacts in dollar terms, not just percentages (more intuitive for clients)
- Always present tax costs alongside rebalancing recommendations
- Prioritize tax-free rebalancing (retirement accounts) before taxable trades
- Consider cash flow rebalancing (directing new money to underweight classes) as the first option
- Document the client's rebalancing decision with date and signature for compliance
- Include visual aids (pie charts, before/after comparisons) when possible
- Frame drift management as maintaining the agreed-upon plan, not predicting markets
