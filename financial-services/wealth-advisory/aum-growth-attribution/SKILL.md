# AUM Growth Attribution

## Overview

Decompose Assets Under Management (AUM) growth into its fundamental drivers to provide transparency into practice health and growth quality. This skill separates market-driven growth (beta) from organic growth (net new assets), further breaking organic growth into client acquisition, existing client contributions, distributions/withdrawals, and client attrition. Attribution enables leadership to distinguish sustainable growth from market-dependent growth and evaluate advisor and team productivity.

## When to Use

- Monthly/quarterly management reporting on practice growth
- Advisor performance evaluation and compensation planning
- Business development strategy assessment and planning
- Forecasting AUM and revenue under various market scenarios
- Benchmarking organic growth rates against industry standards
- Analyzing the sustainability and quality of growth
- Board/stakeholder reporting on wealth management business unit performance

## Required Inputs

| Input | Description | Format |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| AUM snapshots | Beginning and ending AUM for the period | Account-level data |
| Cash flows | All contributions, withdrawals, distributions, fees | Transaction data |
| New accounts | Accounts opened during the period with funding amounts | Account records |
| Closed accounts | Accounts closed/transferred with terminal values | Account records |
| Market returns | Benchmark returns for asset classes held | Market data |
| Fee schedule | Advisory fees charged during the period | Billing data |
| Advisor assignment | Account-to-advisor mapping | CRM data |

## Methodology

### Step 1 — AUM Bridge Construction

Build the period AUM bridge from beginning to ending balance:

```
Beginning AUM
+ Market appreciation/depreciation
+ New client assets (new relationships)
+ Existing client contributions (additional deposits)
- Client withdrawals and distributions
- Client attrition (lost relationships)
- Advisory fees deducted
+ Other adjustments (account transfers, reclassifications)
= Ending AUM
```

Each component must be precisely calculated so the bridge reconciles exactly to the actual ending AUM (no unexplained residual).

### Step 2 — Market Return Attribution

Isolate the market-driven component of AUM change:

- **Method**: Calculate the time-weighted return (TWR) of the aggregate portfolio, then apply to beginning AUM
- **Market appreciation** = Beginning AUM × Portfolio TWR for the period
- **Asset class decomposition**: Break market return into contributions from each asset class:

| Asset Class | Weight (Avg) | Asset Class Return | Contribution to Return |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| US Equity | XX% | X.X% | X.XX% |
| Int'l Equity | XX% | X.X% | X.XX% |
| Fixed Income | XX% | X.X% | X.XX% |
| Alternatives | XX% | X.X% | X.XX% |
| Cash | XX% | X.X% | X.XX% |
| **Total** | **100%** | | **X.XX%** |

- **Brinson attribution**: If applicable, decompose into allocation effect (asset class weighting vs. benchmark) and selection effect (security/manager selection within asset class)
- **Dollar impact**: Market-driven AUM change in dollar terms

### Step 3 — Organic Growth Decomposition

Calculate net new assets (NNA) — the key organic growth metric:

**New client assets:**
- Count of new relationships established
- Total initial funding from new clients
- Average new client size
- Source analysis: Referrals, COI introductions, marketing, organic inquiries
- Cost of acquisition (if available): Marketing spend / new client count

**Existing client net flows:**
- Additional contributions from existing clients (new money)
- Systematic investment plan contributions
- Retirement account rollovers into existing relationships
- One-time events (inheritance deposits, business sale proceeds)
- Scheduled withdrawals and distributions (retirement income, RMDs)
- Ad hoc withdrawals (home purchase, education, emergency)

**Net new assets calculation:**
NNA = New client assets + Existing client contributions - Existing client withdrawals

**Organic growth rate:**
Organic Growth Rate = NNA / Beginning AUM × 100

Industry benchmark for organic growth rate: 3%–5% annually is considered healthy for established practices; 5%+ is strong growth.

### Step 4 — Attrition Analysis

Quantify and analyze client losses:

- **Accounts lost**: Number of relationships terminated or transferred away
- **AUM lost**: Dollar value of assets departing
- **Attrition rate**: Lost AUM / Beginning AUM (annualized)
- **Gross vs. net**: Gross attrition (total departures) vs. net attrition (departures minus new)

**Attrition driver analysis:**

| Reason | Accounts | AUM Lost ($M) | % of Attrition |
|--------|----------|--------------|----------------|
| Moved to competitor | X | $X | XX% |
| Deceased | X | $X | XX% |
| Divorce/relationship split | X | $X | XX% |
| Dissatisfaction | X | $X | XX% |
| Fee sensitivity | X | $X | XX% |
| Advisor departure | X | $X | XX% |
| Account consolidation | X | $X | XX% |
| Other/unknown | X | $X | XX% |

**Controllable vs. uncontrollable attrition**: Separate attrition into controllable (dissatisfaction, fees, competitor — actionable) and uncontrollable (death, relocation, life events — expected baseline).

Industry benchmark: Annual attrition rate of 3%–5% is typical; >7% warrants investigation.

### Step 5 — Revenue Impact Analysis

Connect AUM changes to revenue:

- **Fee revenue bridge**: Map AUM changes to fee revenue impact
  - Market-driven AUM change × average fee rate = Market-driven revenue change
  - NNA × average fee rate × partial-year factor = Organic revenue change
  - Attrition AUM × average fee rate × partial-year factor = Revenue loss
- **Fee rate analysis**: Average fee rate trend (blending effect of new clients vs. departures)
- **Revenue per advisor**: AUM per advisor × average fee rate
- **Breakeven analysis**: NNA required to offset fee compression (if fee rates declining)

### Step 6 — Advisor-Level Attribution

Break down AUM growth by individual advisor or team:

| Advisor | Beg AUM ($M) | Market ($M) | New Clients ($M) | Net Flows ($M) | Attrition ($M) | End AUM ($M) | Organic Rate |
|---------|-------------|------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| [Name] | $XX | $X.X | $X.X | $X.X | ($X.X) | $XX | X.X% |
| [Name] | $XX | $X.X | $X.X | $X.X | ($X.X) | $XX | X.X% |
| **Total** | **$XXX** | **$XX** | **$XX** | **$XX** | **($XX)** | **$XXX** | **X.X%** |

- **Productivity metrics**: New clients per advisor, NNA per advisor, revenue per advisor
- **Ranking**: Rank advisors by organic growth rate for compensation and recognition purposes
- **Trend**: Quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year growth rate trends per advisor
- **Pipeline analysis**: Weighted pipeline of prospective new clients and expected funding

### Step 7 — Forecasting and Scenario Analysis

Project AUM and revenue forward under scenarios:

**Base case:**
- Market return assumption: [X%] (based on CMAs or historical average)
- Organic growth assumption: [X%] (based on trailing 12-month trend)
- Attrition assumption: [X%] (based on trailing 12-month rate)
- Fee rate assumption: [X bps] (current blended rate)
- Projected ending AUM: $[X]
- Projected revenue: $[X]

**Bull case:** Market +[X%], organic growth +[X%], attrition -[X pp]
**Bear case:** Market -[X%], organic growth -[X pp], attrition +[X pp]

## Analysis Framework

Apply the **GRAIN** framework:

- **G**rowth decomposition — Separate market from organic growth precisely
- **R**etention analysis — Quantify and categorize attrition drivers
- **A**dvisor attribution — Assign growth components to individual producers
- **I**ncome impact — Connect AUM changes to revenue effects
- **N**ext period forecast — Project forward under multiple scenarios

## Examples

**Example 1 — Strong Organic Growth Quarter**

Q3 results: Beginning AUM $850M, ending AUM $912M (+$62M, +7.3%). Attribution: Market +$38M (4.5%), new clients +$18M (5 new relationships, avg $3.6M), existing client contributions +$8M, withdrawals -$6M, attrition -$4M (1 relationship lost to competitor), fees -$2M. Organic growth rate: 2.4% for the quarter (9.6% annualized), well above the 3–5% industry benchmark. Growth quality: Strong — organic growth represents 35% of total growth, indicating sustainable practice expansion not purely dependent on market returns.

**Example 2 — Market-Masked Attrition Problem**

YTD results: AUM grew 11% from $1.2B to $1.33B. Surface-level: appears healthy. Attribution: Market +$168M (+14%), new clients +$22M, contributions +$15M, withdrawals -$18M, attrition -$42M (8 relationships lost), fees -$15M. Organic growth rate: -1.9% (net outflows of $23M). Attrition rate: 3.5% (elevated). Diagnosis: Strong market returns masked a net-negative organic growth problem. Without the 14% market tailwind, the practice would have shrunk. Three of 8 lost clients cited fee dissatisfaction. Recommendation: Conduct fee competitiveness analysis, implement client retention program, investigate advisor service quality for clients at risk.

## Guidelines

- Reconcile the AUM bridge exactly to actual ending AUM — no unexplained residuals
- Use time-weighted returns (TWR) for market attribution; money-weighted for client-specific analysis
- Annualize growth rates for comparability across periods of different lengths
- Separate controllable from uncontrollable attrition for actionable insights
- Track organic growth rate as the primary health metric, not total AUM growth
- Benchmark organic growth against industry standards (Cerulli, FA Insight, InvestmentNews benchmarks)
- Include pipeline data in advisor-level reporting to provide leading indicator context
- Present growth quality metrics (organic as % of total) alongside absolute growth
