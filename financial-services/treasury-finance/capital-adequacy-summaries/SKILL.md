# Capital Adequacy Summaries

## Overview

Generates structured, regulator-ready summaries of the bank's capital position covering CET1/Tier 1/Total Capital ratios, RWA composition and movement, leverage ratio, capital buffers (CCB, CCyB, G-SIB/D-SIB), and forward capital planning under stress. Designed for ALCO reporting, board risk committee presentations, ICAAP narratives, and investor communications.

## When to Use

- Preparing quarterly capital adequacy reports for ALCO or board
- Drafting ICAAP narrative sections on capital adequacy and planning
- Explaining period-over-period movements in capital ratios
- Analyzing RWA density and optimization opportunities
- Assessing capital buffer compliance and distribution constraints
- Supporting stress testing capital projections and management actions

## Methodology

### Step 1 — Compile the Capital Stack

Build the regulatory capital waterfall:

**CET1 Capital:**
- Common shares and share premium
- Retained earnings
- Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) — note AOCI opt-out elections if applicable
- Minus: Goodwill and intangibles (net of deferred tax)
- Minus: Deferred tax assets exceeding 10%/15% thresholds
- Minus: Investments in financial institutions (reciprocal, non-significant, significant)
- Minus: Other regulatory deductions (expected loss shortfall, securitization deductions)

**Additional Tier 1 (AT1):** Qualifying perpetual instruments with loss absorption triggers (CET1 trigger ≥ 5.125%)

**Tier 2 Capital:** Qualifying subordinated debt (minimum 5-year original maturity, amortized in final 5 years), eligible general provisions (up to 1.25% of credit risk RWA under standardized approach)

### Step 2 — Decompose Risk-Weighted Assets

Break down total RWA by risk type and sub-category:

**Credit risk RWA** (typically 80-90% of total):
- By approach: Standardized (SA) vs. Internal Ratings-Based (IRB: Foundation or Advanced)
- By asset class: Sovereign, institution, corporate, retail (mortgage, qualifying revolving, other), equity, securitization
- RWA density (RWA / Exposure at Default) by asset class to identify heavy vs. light portfolios

**Market risk RWA** (typically 3-8%):
- Standardized approach vs. Internal Models Approach (IMA)
- By risk factor: interest rate, equity, FX, commodity, credit spread (FRTB SA-specific)
- Stressed VaR and incremental risk charge contributions

**Operational risk RWA** (typically 8-15%):
- Basic Indicator, Standardized, or Advanced Measurement Approach
- Business Indicator Approach (BIA) under Basel III finalization

**Credit valuation adjustment (CVA) RWA**: Mark-to-market counterparty credit risk on derivatives

### Step 3 — Calculate Ratios and Buffer Compliance

Compute regulatory ratios:
- **CET1 ratio** = CET1 Capital / Total RWA
- **Tier 1 ratio** = (CET1 + AT1) / Total RWA
- **Total Capital ratio** = (CET1 + AT1 + Tier 2) / Total RWA
- **Leverage ratio** = Tier 1 Capital / Leverage Exposure Measure (target ≥ 3%)

Assess buffer compliance:
- **Pillar 1 minimums**: CET1 ≥ 4.5%, Tier 1 ≥ 6.0%, Total Capital ≥ 8.0%
- **Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB)**: 2.5% CET1
- **Countercyclical Buffer (CCyB)**: Jurisdiction-weighted average (0-2.5% CET1)
- **G-SIB / D-SIB surcharge**: Institution-specific (1-3.5% CET1)
- **Combined buffer requirement (CBR)** = CCB + CCyB + G-SIB/D-SIB
- **Maximum Distributable Amount (MDA)**: If CET1 falls within CBR, dividend and AT1 coupon restrictions apply proportionally

### Step 4 — Analyze Period-over-Period Movements

Decompose capital ratio changes into:
- **Numerator effects** (ΔCapital):
  - Organic capital generation: Net income − Dividends − Share buybacks
  - AOCI movements (unrealized gains/losses on AFS securities, pension adjustments)
  - Regulatory deduction changes (goodwill from acquisitions, DTA movements)
  - Issuance or redemption of AT1/Tier 2 instruments
- **Denominator effects** (ΔRWA):
  - Asset growth/contraction effect
  - Credit quality migration (rating upgrades/downgrades in IRB portfolios)
  - Model updates or recalibration
  - Regulatory methodology changes
  - Securitization or risk transfer transactions

### Step 5 — Stress Test Capital Trajectory

Present capital projections under stress scenarios:
- **Base case**: Business-as-usual with plan assumptions
- **Adverse**: Moderate economic downturn (200-300bps GDP decline)
- **Severely adverse**: Severe recession (400bps+ GDP decline, 30%+ equity market decline, credit spread widening)

For each scenario, project:
- Pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) trajectory
- Credit loss projections by portfolio
- RWA migration under stressed PDs and LGDs
- Capital ratio trajectory over 9-quarter (CCAR) or 3-year (EBA) horizon
- Minimum capital ratio reached (trough) and quarter in which it occurs
- Distance to MDA trigger at trough

### Step 6 — Assess Capital Optimization Opportunities

Identify levers to improve capital efficiency:
- **RWA optimization**: Credit risk mitigation (guarantees, collateral, netting), securitization, portfolio rebalancing toward lower-density asset classes
- **Capital structure optimization**: Replace expensive equity with AT1 or Tier 2 where capacity exists
- **Model enhancements**: IRB model recalibration, data quality improvements reducing conservatism
- **Exposure management**: Active credit portfolio management, loan sales, synthetic risk transfer
- Quantify each opportunity in bps of CET1 ratio improvement and dollar RWA reduction

### Step 7 — Construct the Executive Summary

Synthesize into a structured narrative:
1. **Headline ratios**: Current CET1, Tier 1, Total Capital, Leverage ratios with trend direction
2. **Key movements**: Top 3-5 drivers of ratio change with quantified impacts
3. **Buffer compliance**: Distance to MDA restriction in bps and absolute terms
4. **Stress resilience**: Trough CET1 under severely adverse with distance to minimum
5. **Capital actions**: Planned dividends, buybacks, issuance, and their ratio impact
6. **Peer positioning**: Ranking relative to peers on CET1 and leverage ratio
7. **Outlook and risks**: Known upcoming impacts (regulatory changes, model approvals, planned transactions)

## Analysis Framework

Apply the **Capital Adequacy Triangle**:
1. **Regulatory compliance**: Meeting minimum ratios plus buffer requirements without distribution restrictions
2. **Stress resilience**: Maintaining adequate capital through severe but plausible stress scenarios
3. **Strategic capacity**: Retaining sufficient headroom to fund organic growth, M&A, and shareholder returns

All three dimensions must be satisfied simultaneously; optimizing one at the expense of others creates vulnerability.

## Examples

**Example — CET1 Improvement Narrative:**
"CET1 strengthened 32bps to 13.2% in Q3, driven by organic capital generation of +48bps ($1.9B retained earnings after dividends) partially offset by RWA growth of -22bps from $8.4B of commercial loan originations (average RWA density 72%). The ratio stands 420bps above the MDA trigger of 8.98% (P1 minimum 4.5% + CCB 2.5% + G-SIB 1.5% + CCyB 0.48%), providing $16.7B of distributable capital capacity."

**Example — Stress Resilience Statement:**
"Under the severely adverse scenario, CET1 declines from 13.2% to a trough of 9.8% in Q6, driven by $7.2B of projected credit losses (primarily CRE and leveraged lending) and $2.1B of AOCI deterioration on the AFS portfolio. The trough ratio remains 82bps above the MDA trigger, confirming the capital plan's sustainability through severe stress without distribution restrictions."

## Guidelines

- Always present the full capital stack (CET1, Tier 1, Total Capital) not just CET1
- Include the leverage ratio alongside risk-based ratios
- Express buffer compliance in both bps and absolute dollar terms
- Decompose ratio movements into numerator and denominator effects separately
- Include MDA trigger calculation and distance to restriction
- Use consistent RWA density metrics (RWA/EAD) for cross-portfolio comparability
- State all ratios on a transitional and fully-loaded basis where AOCI phase-in applies
