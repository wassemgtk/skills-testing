# Cash Flow Variance Analysis

## Overview

Systematically decomposes the variance between forecast and actual cash flows to identify root causes—timing shifts, volume deviations, behavioral assumption errors, market-driven changes, and operational factors. Enables treasury to improve forecast accuracy, refine behavioral models, enhance liquidity planning, and provide transparent variance explanations to ALCO and regulators.

## When to Use

- Explaining material variance between forecast and actual daily/weekly/monthly cash positions
- Analyzing the accuracy of liquidity forecasting models
- Identifying systemic biases in cash flow projection assumptions
- Improving behavioral models for deposit flows, loan prepayments, and drawdowns
- Reporting cash position variance to ALCO with actionable root-cause analysis
- Calibrating contingency funding plan assumptions based on observed flows

## Required Inputs

| Input | Description | Format |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Forecast cash flows | Projected inflows and outflows by category and time bucket | Time-bucketed table |
| Actual cash flows | Realized inflows and outflows by category and time bucket | Time-bucketed table |
| Behavioral assumptions | Deposit run-off, prepayment, drawdown, and rollover rates used in forecast | Parameter table |
| Business plan data | Planned originations, maturities, and balance sheet movements | Plan vs. actual |
| Market data | Rate changes, spread movements affecting cash flows | Market observations |
| Operational events | Unplanned events (large withdrawals, settlement failures, system issues) | Event log |
| Historical variance | Prior period variance data for trend and bias analysis | Time series |

## Methodology

### Step 1 — Establish the Variance Framework

Organize the variance analysis into a structured taxonomy:

**Primary variance categories:**
- **Volume variance**: Actual balance changes differ from forecast (larger/smaller flows)
- **Timing variance**: Correct amounts but different timing (early/late settlement, delayed maturities)
- **Rate/price variance**: Market rate changes affecting cash flow amounts (floating-rate coupons, FX)
- **Behavioral variance**: Actual customer behavior differs from modeled assumptions
- **Operational variance**: Unplanned events, system issues, counterparty actions
- **Model variance**: Structural deficiencies in the forecasting methodology

Total Variance = Volume + Timing + Rate + Behavioral + Operational + Model

### Step 2 — Compute Gross and Net Variances

For each cash flow category (asset inflows, liability outflows, off-balance-sheet, operations):

- **Gross variance** = |Actual − Forecast| (absolute magnitude, captures total forecasting error)
- **Net variance** = Actual − Forecast (directional, captures bias)
- **Variance ratio** = Net Variance / Forecast (relative magnitude for comparability)

Analyze at multiple aggregation levels:
- Individual cash flow line items (e.g., residential mortgage prepayments)
- Category subtotals (e.g., total loan portfolio cash flows)
- Grand total net cash position variance

Flag any line item where |variance ratio| > 10% as material for root-cause investigation.

### Step 3 — Decompose by Variance Type

For each material variance, attribute to specific drivers:

**Volume variance analysis:**
- Planned originations vs. actual: Were new loans/deposits higher or lower than plan?
- Unplanned maturities or terminations: Early repayments, deposit closures, contract cancellations
- Pipeline conversion: Committed facilities that drew down vs. remained undrawn
- Quantify: (Actual Volume − Forecast Volume) × Forecast Rate = Volume Variance

**Timing variance analysis:**
- Settlement date shifts: Payments or receipts arriving earlier or later than contractual date
- End-of-period cutoff effects: Transactions straddling the reporting boundary
- Seasonal patterns not captured in the forecast
- Quantify by netting across adjacent time buckets (pure timing variance nets to zero over longer horizons)

**Behavioral variance analysis:**
- Deposit run-off: Actual withdrawal rates vs. modeled decay functions
- Loan prepayments: Actual CPR vs. projected prepayment speeds
- Facility drawdowns: Actual utilization vs. modeled drawdown rates
- Rollover rates: Actual renewal rates on maturing deposits/wholesale funding vs. assumed
- Quantify: (Actual Behavioral Rate − Modeled Rate) × Relevant Balance = Behavioral Variance

**Rate/price variance analysis:**
- Floating-rate coupon resets at different rates than forecast
- FX rate changes affecting foreign-currency cash flows
- Spread changes affecting market-based funding costs

### Step 4 — Assess Forecast Bias

Analyze systematic forecast errors over a rolling 6-12 month window:

- **Mean forecast error (MFE)**: Average of (Actual − Forecast); non-zero indicates persistent bias
  - Positive MFE: Systematic under-forecasting of net cash inflows (conservative bias)
  - Negative MFE: Systematic over-forecasting (optimistic bias)
- **Mean absolute forecast error (MAFE)**: Average of |Actual − Forecast|; measures accuracy irrespective of direction
- **Forecast accuracy ratio**: 1 − (MAFE / Average Actual); higher is better, target >90%
- **Bias by category**: Identify which cash flow categories have the largest systematic bias
- **Directional accuracy**: Percentage of periods where the forecast correctly predicted the direction of net flows

### Step 5 — Assess Liquidity Impact

Translate cash flow variances into liquidity risk implications:

- **Intraday impact**: Did the variance cause intraday overdrafts or require unexpected repo borrowing?
- **Buffer impact**: How did the variance affect the HQLA buffer or LCR calculation?
- **Limit impact**: Did the variance cause a breach of internal liquidity limits or early-warning triggers?
- **Cost impact**: Quantify the cost of unexpected borrowing or opportunity cost of excess liquidity
- **Stress calibration**: Should contingency funding plan assumptions be recalibrated based on observed variance?

### Step 6 — Identify Actionable Improvements

Based on the root-cause analysis, recommend specific improvements:

**Model improvements:**
- Recalibrate behavioral parameters (update deposit decay functions, prepayment models, drawdown rates)
- Incorporate new variables (e.g., digital channel deposit behavior, macroeconomic indicators)
- Adjust confidence intervals on forecasts to reflect observed variance

**Process improvements:**
- Enhance communication with business lines for large transaction visibility
- Implement T+1 rolling forecast updates for high-variance categories
- Add conditional forecast branches for known upcoming events (rate decisions, large maturities)

**Reporting improvements:**
- Add variance dashboards with trend visualization
- Implement traffic-light early-warning for forecast deviation
- Report forecast accuracy KPIs alongside cash flow data

### Step 7 — Compile the Variance Report

Structure the final output:
1. **Headline variance**: Net cash position variance with materiality assessment
2. **Variance waterfall**: Decomposition into volume, timing, rate, behavioral, operational, model
3. **Top 5 line-item variances**: Material items with root-cause explanation
4. **Forecast accuracy metrics**: MFE, MAFE, accuracy ratio, directional accuracy
5. **Liquidity impact**: Any limit breaches, cost impacts, or stress calibration implications
6. **Trend analysis**: Is forecast accuracy improving or deteriorating over time?
7. **Action items**: Specific model, process, or reporting improvements with owners

## Analysis Framework

Apply the **Forecast-Observe-Analyze-Improve (FOAI) cycle**:
1. **Forecast**: Generate projections using behavioral models and business plan inputs
2. **Observe**: Capture actual cash flows at equivalent granularity to forecasts
3. **Analyze**: Decompose variance into the six variance categories with root-cause attribution
4. **Improve**: Update models, refine assumptions, enhance processes based on findings

Each FOAI cycle iteration should demonstrably improve forecast accuracy metrics.

## Examples

**Example — Behavioral Variance Narrative:**
"The $340M net cash outflow variance was primarily driven by behavioral variance in the retail deposit portfolio (-$280M). Actual demand deposit outflows exceeded the modeled 3% monthly decay rate, with observed outflows at 4.7%, reflecting increased competitive pressure from online banks offering 80bps above our posted rate. The prepayment model also underestimated residential mortgage prepayments by $95M as refinancing activity spiked following the 50bps rate cut. Recommendation: recalibrate the deposit decay function to incorporate competitive rate differential as an explanatory variable."

**Example — Timing Variance Narrative:**
"Total gross variance of $620M reduces to a net variance of only $45M after netting timing effects across adjacent weeks. A $380M corporate loan repayment expected in Week 2 settled in Week 3, and a $195M institutional deposit inflow forecast for Week 3 arrived in Week 2. These timing shifts, while netting out over the month, caused a $380M intraday liquidity shortfall on Day 8 requiring a $400M overnight repo at a cost of $52K. Recommendation: implement T+1 large-transaction settlement tracking for flows exceeding $100M."

## Guidelines

- Always distinguish between gross and net variance (gross measures accuracy, net measures bias)
- Decompose into all six variance categories; do not lump residual into 'other'
- Report forecast accuracy metrics over rolling windows, not single periods
- Quantify the cost of forecast errors (borrowing cost, opportunity cost, limit breach)
- Separate timing variance from true volume variance by netting across adjacent periods
- Update behavioral parameters quarterly based on observed variance analysis
- Flag persistent biases (>3 consecutive periods in same direction) for immediate model recalibration
