# Early Delinquency Predictor

## Overview

Identify loans at elevated risk of transitioning into delinquency before the first missed payment occurs. This skill combines behavioral payment signals, credit bureau trend data, macroeconomic overlays, and account-level risk characteristics to produce a probability-of-delinquency score. Outputs enable proactive loss mitigation outreach, reserve forecasting, and targeted collections resource allocation.

## When to Use

- Building or refining early warning systems for retail or commercial portfolios
- Prioritizing pre-delinquency outreach and borrower assistance programs
- Forecasting delinquency pipelines for reserve adequacy (CECL Stage 1 → Stage 2 migration)
- Evaluating loan modification or forbearance program targeting
- Identifying origination risk factors correlated with early payment default (EPD)
- Stress testing portfolio delinquency under adverse macroeconomic scenarios

## Required Inputs

| Input | Description | Format |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Payment history | Monthly payment records with amounts and dates | Time series |
| Bureau refreshes | Updated FICO, tradeline data, inquiry activity | Periodic pulls |
| Account attributes | Origination terms, current balance, rate, LTV | Loan-level data |
| Behavioral data | Login frequency, contact history, payment channel changes | CRM/servicing |
| Macro indicators | Unemployment rate, HPI, consumer confidence by geography | Economic feeds |
| Historical outcomes | Prior delinquency and default outcomes for model calibration | Performance data |

## Methodology

### Step 1 — Feature Engineering from Payment Behavior

Extract predictive signals from payment patterns before a missed payment occurs:

- **Payment timing drift**: Moving average of days-before-due-date trending toward due date or past it
- **Partial payment frequency**: Increasing incidence of payments below scheduled amount
- **Payment channel changes**: Shift from auto-pay to manual payment (disengagement signal)
- **Payment amount volatility**: Standard deviation of payment amounts over trailing 6 months
- **Excess payment cessation**: Borrower who previously paid above minimum now pays exactly minimum
- **NSF/returned payment history**: Any returned payments in trailing 12 months

### Step 2 — Bureau-Based Deterioration Signals

Identify credit deterioration from refreshed bureau data:

- **FICO score decline**: Drop of >20 points from origination or trailing 6-month trend
- **Utilization spike**: Revolving utilization increase >15 percentage points
- **New derogatory tradelines**: 30+ DPD on other accounts, collections, judgments
- **Inquiry velocity**: >3 new credit inquiries in 90 days (liquidity-seeking behavior)
- **New debt accumulation**: Significant increase in total outstanding debt
- **Account closures**: Creditor-initiated closures on other tradelines

### Step 3 — Account-Level Risk Characteristics

Assess static and dynamic account risk factors:

- **Seasoning**: Months on book (EPD risk highest in months 1–12)
- **Current LTV**: Mark-to-market LTV using updated property/collateral values
- **Rate type and reset risk**: ARM reset proximity, payment shock magnitude
- **DTI at origination**: Higher origination DTI correlates with lower payment cushion
- **Borrower reserves at origination**: Months of reserves documented at closing
- **Exception-to-policy origination**: Loans originated with policy exceptions carry elevated risk

### Step 4 — Macroeconomic Overlay

Incorporate geographic and macroeconomic conditions:

- **Local unemployment rate**: Current and trajectory for the borrower's MSA
- **Home price index**: HPI trend for the property's ZIP code (collateral support erosion)
- **Consumer confidence**: Regional consumer sentiment indices
- **Interest rate environment**: Impact on variable-rate payment obligations
- **Industry-specific stress**: Sector-level employment and revenue trends for commercial borrowers

Weight macroeconomic factors by their historical correlation with delinquency in the portfolio's specific asset class.

### Step 5 — Probability Scoring and Segmentation

Combine all features into a delinquency probability score:

- Apply a calibrated logistic regression, gradient-boosted tree, or ensemble model
- Output a probability of 30+ DPD within the next 3 months and 6 months
- Segment the portfolio into risk tiers:
  - **Green (0–5%)**: Standard monitoring
  - **Yellow (5–15%)**: Enhanced monitoring, soft-touch outreach eligible
  - **Orange (15–30%)**: Proactive loss mitigation contact required
  - **Red (>30%)**: Urgent intervention, workout team assignment
- Calculate expected roll rates from each tier to deeper delinquency stages

### Step 6 — Model Validation and Calibration

Ensure prediction quality through:

- **Discrimination**: Gini coefficient / AUC-ROC > 0.70 (target > 0.75)
- **Calibration**: Hosmer-Lemeshow test, predicted vs. actual by decile
- **Stability**: Population Stability Index (PSI) < 0.10 for feature distributions
- **Back-testing**: Out-of-time validation on most recent 4 quarters
- **Segmental performance**: AUC by product type, geography, and vintage
- **Override tracking**: Monitor manual overrides of model scores for effectiveness

### Step 7 — Action Framework and Reporting

Map prediction tiers to specific interventions:

- **Green**: Standard servicing, no additional action
- **Yellow**: Automated borrower check-in (email/SMS), payment reminder enhancement
- **Orange**: Live outreach call, financial hardship assessment, modification evaluation
- **Red**: Dedicated workout specialist, forbearance/modification offer, collateral review

Generate reports showing:
- Portfolio distribution across risk tiers with period-over-period trend
- Top contributing features for each tier (model explainability)
- Projected delinquency pipeline (expected new 30/60/90 DPD accounts)
- Resource allocation recommendations for collections/loss mitigation staff

## Analysis Framework

Apply the **BERM** framework:

- **B**ehavioral signals — Payment pattern changes preceding delinquency
- **E**xternal data — Bureau deterioration and macroeconomic stress
- **R**isk characteristics — Account-level static and dynamic risk factors
- **M**odel governance — Validation, calibration, and monitoring rigor

## Examples

**Example 1 — Behavioral Signal Detection**

Loan 10045832: 30-year mortgage, 18 MOB. Payment timing drifted from avg 12 days early to 2 days before due date over 4 months. Auto-pay cancelled in month 16. Revolving utilization spiked from 42% to 78%. FICO dropped 35 points. Model score: 0.34 (Red tier). Action: Assigned to workout specialist for proactive hardship assessment. Outcome: Borrower disclosed job loss; approved for 3-month forbearance, avoided default.

**Example 2 — Geographic Macro Overlay**

Portfolio segment: 847 auto loans in Houston MSA. Local unemployment rose from 4.1% to 6.8% in 2 quarters. Model recalibrated with macro overlay shifted 124 accounts from Green to Yellow, 38 from Yellow to Orange. Automated outreach campaign triggered for Yellow accounts; live calls initiated for Orange. Result: 60-day delinquency rate for the cohort was 3.2% vs. 5.8% for non-contacted comparable accounts.

## Guidelines

- Refresh bureau-based features at least quarterly; payment behavior features monthly
- Calibrate the model at least annually; recalibrate immediately after significant macro shifts
- Monitor PSI monthly to detect feature distribution drift that degrades model performance
- Ensure fair lending compliance: model features must not include prohibited basis factors or proxies
- Document feature selection rationale and adverse impact testing results
- Integrate prediction outputs with the loan servicing platform for automated action triggers
- Track intervention outcomes to measure lift from proactive outreach programs
- Maintain model governance documentation per SR 11-7 / OCC 2011-12 guidance
