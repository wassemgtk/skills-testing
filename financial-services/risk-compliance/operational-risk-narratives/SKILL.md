# Operational Risk Narratives

## Overview

This skill produces structured operational risk event narratives and analyses for financial institutions. It covers loss event documentation, root cause analysis (RCA), risk and control self-assessments (RCSA), key risk indicator (KRI) analysis, scenario analysis, and operational risk capital estimation. Output aligns with Basel III/IV operational risk framework, OCC Heightened Standards, and industry taxonomies (ORX, Basel event types).

## When to Use

- Documenting operational loss events for the internal loss database
- Conducting root cause analysis for material loss events
- Drafting operational risk committee reports and board summaries
- Analyzing KRI breaches and trend deterioration
- Performing RCSA facilitation and documentation
- Supporting Basel III standardized measurement approach (SMA) calculations
- Preparing operational risk scenario analysis narratives for stress testing

## Required Inputs

| Input | Description | Format |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Event details | What happened, when, where, who was involved | Incident report |
| Financial impact | Gross loss, recoveries, near-miss estimate | Dollar amounts |
| Basel event type | Level 1 and Level 2 event classification | Basel taxonomy |
| Business line | Affected business unit per Basel classification | Business line mapping |
| Control environment | Controls that failed or were absent | Control inventory |
| Timeline | Event occurrence, detection, escalation, resolution | Chronological dates |
| Prior events | Related historical events or trends | Loss database query |

## Methodology

### Step 1: Classify the Event

Apply the Basel II/III operational risk event type taxonomy:

| Level 1 Category | Level 2 Examples | Typical Drivers |
|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Internal fraud** | Unauthorized activity, theft | Insider threat, control bypass |
| **External fraud** | Theft/robbery, systems security, forgery | Cyber attack, social engineering |
| **Employment practices** | Discrimination, workers comp, labor disputes | HR policy gaps, culture issues |
| **Clients, products, suitability** | Fiduciary breaches, mis-selling, disclosure | Compliance failures, training gaps |
| **Damage to physical assets** | Natural disasters, terrorism, vandalism | BCP gaps, physical security |
| **Business disruption** | Systems failures, utility outages, telecom | IT resilience, vendor dependency |
| **Execution, delivery, process management** | Data entry errors, accounting errors, failed settlement | Process design, human error |

Also classify by:
- **Business line**: Corporate finance, trading, retail banking, commercial banking, payment and settlement, agency services, asset management, retail brokerage
- **Boundary event**: Credit-risk-related operational events, market-risk-related operational events

### Step 2: Document the Event Narrative

Construct a comprehensive, fact-based narrative:

**Event description** (what happened):
- Precise description of the event without editorializing
- Specific actions or failures that occurred
- Systems, processes, and people involved

**Detection** (how it was found):
- How and when the event was detected
- Time lag between occurrence and detection (detection gap)
- Detection mechanism (automated alert, employee report, customer complaint, audit finding, regulatory examination)

**Impact** (what was the result):
- Direct financial loss (gross amount before recoveries)
- Indirect costs (remediation, legal, regulatory fines, reputational)
- Customer impact (number of customers affected, complaint volume)
- Regulatory impact (enforcement action, MRA/MRIA, consent order)

**Resolution** (what was done):
- Immediate containment actions
- Customer remediation steps
- Process or control changes implemented
- Timeline to full resolution

### Step 3: Perform Root Cause Analysis

Apply structured RCA methodology:

**Five Whys Analysis**:
1. Why did the event occur? → [Proximate cause]
2. Why did the proximate cause exist? → [Contributing factor]
3. Why was that factor present? → [Process weakness]
4. Why wasn't the weakness addressed? → [Governance gap]
5. Why did governance fail? → [Root cause]

**Root Cause Categories**:
| Category | Sub-Categories |
|----------|---------------|
| **People** | Training, competency, staffing, misconduct, culture |
| **Process** | Design gaps, procedure non-compliance, handoff failures |
| **Systems** | IT failure, data quality, system capacity, cyber vulnerability |
| **External** | Vendor failure, regulatory change, fraud, natural disaster |
| **Governance** | Oversight gaps, policy deficiency, risk appetite misalignment |

### Step 4: Assess Control Failures

Evaluate the control environment that should have prevented or detected the event:

| Control | Type | Design | Operating Effectiveness | Failure Mode |
|---------|------|--------|------------------------|-------------|
| [Control 1] | Preventive/Detective | Adequate/Inadequate | Effective/Ineffective | [How it failed] |
| [Control 2] | Preventive/Detective | Adequate/Inadequate | Effective/Ineffective | [How it failed] |

Distinguish between:
- **Control design failure**: The control was not designed to address this risk
- **Control operating failure**: The control was properly designed but not executed correctly
- **Control absence**: No control existed for this risk scenario

### Step 5: Quantify Financial Impact

Calculate the full financial impact:

| Component | Amount | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Gross loss (direct) | [$X] | Actual / Estimated |
| Legal and regulatory costs | [$X] | Actual / Estimated |
| Remediation costs | [$X] | Actual / Estimated |
| **Total gross loss** | **[$X]** | |
| Insurance recovery | -[$X] | Received / Expected |
| Other recoveries | -[$X] | Received / Expected |
| **Net loss** | **[$X]** | |

For near-miss events, estimate the potential loss had the event not been detected or contained.

### Step 6: Develop Corrective Action Plan

Define specific, measurable remediation actions:

| # | Action | Owner | Deadline | Priority | Status |
|---|--------|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | [Specific action] | [Name/Role] | [Date] | [Critical/High/Medium] | [Open/In Progress/Complete] |

Each action must:
- Address a specific root cause or control gap identified
- Be measurable (clear definition of "done")
- Have an accountable owner (individual, not committee)
- Include a realistic deadline based on complexity
- Be tracked to completion with evidence of implementation

### Step 7: Connect to Risk Framework

Link the event to the broader operational risk framework:
- Update the RCSA to reflect the event and new/modified controls
- Review and adjust KRI thresholds if the event signals calibration issues
- Assess whether scenario analysis assumptions need revision
- Evaluate impact on operational risk capital (SMA calculation under Basel IV)
- Update risk appetite and tolerance metrics if breached
- Report through governance (OpRisk committee, board risk committee)

## Analysis Framework

### KRI Breach Analysis

When a KRI breaches its threshold, produce:
- KRI metric, current value, threshold (amber and red), and trend direction
- Root cause of the breach (event-driven, systemic deterioration, data quality)
- Comparison to historical KRI performance (is this an outlier or trend?)
- Recommended management response and threshold recalibration assessment

### RCSA Facilitation

For risk and control self-assessment narratives:
- Identify inherent risk level for each operational risk category
- Assess control effectiveness (1-5 scale with evidence)
- Calculate residual risk (inherent risk adjusted for control effectiveness)
- Compare residual risk to risk appetite and identify gaps
- Document action plans for residual risk exceeding appetite

### Loss Distribution Analysis

For capital and trending purposes:
- Frequency analysis: event count by category, business line, and time period
- Severity analysis: loss distribution with mean, median, 95th, and 99th percentiles
- Trend analysis: rolling 12-month loss trends by category
- Concentration: identify categories representing disproportionate loss share

## Examples

**Example 1 — Process Failure Event**:
"Event OR-2025-0847: On 2025-09-12, a wire transfer of $3.2M was executed to an incorrect beneficiary due to a manual data entry error in the wire instruction template. The error was detected by the receiving bank within 4 hours, and $3.05M was recovered within 3 business days. Net loss of $150K reflects the unrecovered portion plus legal costs. Root cause: absence of maker-checker control for wire template modifications exceeding $1M (control gap). Contributing factors: staffing pressure due to month-end processing volume and lack of automated beneficiary validation against master file. Corrective actions: (1) Implement dual authorization for wire template changes >$500K (owner: Payments Ops Manager, due: 2025-10-31); (2) Deploy automated beneficiary name/account matching against counterparty master file (owner: IT, due: 2025-12-31)."

**Example 2 — Cyber Event**:
"Event OR-2025-1203: Business email compromise (BEC) attack targeted the CFO's email account, resulting in a fraudulent wire instruction of $890K to an overseas account. The attack exploited a phishing email that bypassed email security filters. Detection occurred 48 hours after wire execution when the CFO identified the spoofed email during routine inbox review. $0 recovered; funds moved through multiple intermediary accounts. Basel Event Type: External Fraud — Systems Security. Root cause: inadequate email authentication controls (DMARC policy set to 'none' rather than 'reject'). Corrective actions: (1) Implement DMARC reject policy (IT Security, 30 days); (2) Deploy callback verification for all wire requests >$100K (Treasury Ops, 15 days); (3) Mandatory BEC awareness training for all finance staff (HR/Compliance, 45 days)."

## Guidelines

- Document all operational loss events exceeding the institution's reporting threshold (typically $10K-$25K)
- Capture near-miss events for trend analysis even when no financial loss occurs
- Apply consistent Basel event type taxonomy; avoid creating custom categories
- Root cause analysis must go beyond proximate cause to identify systemic issues
- Corrective actions must address root causes, not symptoms
- Track corrective actions to closure with evidence that the fix is effective
- Distinguish between actual losses (realized) and provisions/reserves (estimated future)
- Include timing information: occurrence-to-detection gap is a key control effectiveness metric
- Maintain objectivity; event narratives are factual records, not blame assignments
- Aggregate related events when a single root cause produces multiple loss impacts
