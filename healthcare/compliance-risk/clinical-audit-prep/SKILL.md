# Clinical Audit Preparation

## Overview

Systematically prepare healthcare organizations for clinical audits and accreditation surveys by assessing compliance against applicable standards, organizing supporting documentation, identifying remediation priorities, and generating audit-ready summary reports. Audits from the Joint Commission (TJC), CMS Conditions of Participation (CoPs), state health departments, and commercial payers each have distinct scopes and methodologies. This skill addresses preparation across audit types, with emphasis on the clinical documentation, care delivery processes, and quality measurement evidence that auditors evaluate most critically.

## When to Use

- Preparing for a scheduled Joint Commission triennial survey
- Responding to a CMS Condition-level or Standard-level survey
- Organizing documentation for a payer medical record audit
- Conducting internal mock survey or audit readiness assessment
- Addressing a Statement of Deficiency (CMS Form 2567) or Requirement for Improvement (TJC)
- Preparing for state health department licensure or complaint surveys
- Responding to Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) or UPIC audit requests
- Evaluating ongoing accreditation compliance between survey cycles

## Required Inputs

| Input | Description | Format |

## Methodology

### Step 1: Audit Scope and Standards Mapping

Identify the specific standards and requirements for the audit type:

**Joint Commission Standards (Hospital Accreditation):**

| Chapter | Key Standards | Focus Areas |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| NPSG | National Patient Safety Goals | Patient identification, medication safety, infection prevention |
| PC | Provision of Care | Assessment, treatment planning, care coordination, discharge |
| MM | Medication Management | Ordering, dispensing, administration, monitoring |
| IC | Infection Prevention | Surveillance, hand hygiene, isolation, antibiotic stewardship |
| RC | Record of Care | Documentation completeness, timeliness, accuracy |
| LD | Leadership | Culture of safety, resource allocation, performance improvement |
| HR | Human Resources | Competency, training, credentialing |
| EC | Environment of Care | Safety, utilities, emergency management |
| IM | Information Management | Data integrity, confidentiality, availability |

**CMS Conditions of Participation (42 CFR 482 — Hospitals):**
- Governing body, patient rights, QAPI, medical staff, nursing services
- Infection control, pharmaceutical services, laboratory
- Medical record services, discharge planning, organ procurement
- Surgical services, anesthesia, emergency services

### Step 2: Documentation Inventory and Gap Assessment

Assess the availability and currency of required documentation:

**Policy and Procedure Review:**
- Verify all required policies exist, are current (reviewed within organizational timeframe), and are approved
- Confirm policies align with current regulatory requirements and evidence-based practices
- Check that policies are accessible to staff and that staff awareness is documented
- Flag policies overdue for review or inconsistent with actual practice

**Clinical Documentation Assessment:**
- Pull a stratified random sample of medical records (minimum 30 records, or per audit methodology)
- Evaluate against documentation standards for completeness, timeliness, and accuracy
- Check informed consent, H&P, operative reports, discharge summaries, medication reconciliation
- Assess compliance with National Patient Safety Goals documentation requirements

**Credential Files Review:**
- Verify provider credential files contain all required elements (license, DEA, board certification, malpractice history)
- Confirm privileges are current and match actual practice
- Check Allied Health Professional supervision agreements
- Verify OPPE (Ongoing Professional Practice Evaluation) and FPPE (Focused Professional Practice Evaluation) documentation

### Step 3: Quality Measure Compliance Verification

Assess performance on applicable quality measures:

**Core Measures and Quality Programs:**
- Joint Commission performance measures (if applicable to accreditation program)
- CMS quality reporting programs (IQR, OQR, MIPS)
- HEDIS measures (for managed care organizations)
- Leapfrog safety grades and reporting
- State-mandated quality reporting

**Data Validation:**
- Verify data abstraction accuracy against medical record documentation
- Confirm numerator/denominator definitions match measure specifications
- Check for appropriate exclusions and exceptions
- Compare submitted data to source documentation for selected cases

### Step 4: Prior Finding Resolution Verification

Confirm that previous audit findings have been resolved:

- Map each prior finding to the corrective action plan submitted
- Verify the corrective action was implemented as described
- Confirm the improvement has been sustained (not just temporarily fixed)
- Gather evidence demonstrating ongoing compliance
- For Joint Commission: verify Requirements for Improvement (RFIs) and Evidence of Standards Compliance (ESC) have been addressed
- For CMS: verify Plan of Correction for each tag on Form 2567 has been implemented and sustained

### Step 5: Tracer Preparation

Prepare for Joint Commission tracer methodology:

**Individual Patient Tracers:**
- Select representative patients across high-risk service lines
- Follow the patient's journey through the organization
- At each point, verify compliance with applicable standards
- Prepare staff to articulate how standards are met during patient care
- Common tracer focus areas: medication management, infection control, patient assessment, care transitions

**System Tracers:**
- Medication management system tracer: ordering through administration
- Data management system tracer: data collection, analysis, reporting, action
- Infection prevention system tracer: surveillance, prevention, reporting
- Emergency management tracer: preparedness, response, recovery

**Program-Specific Tracers:**
- Stroke, hip/knee replacement, heart failure, or other disease-specific certification tracers

### Step 6: Staff Readiness Assessment

Prepare workforce members for surveyor interactions:

- **Knowledge assessment**: Verify staff can articulate key policies, safety goals, and their role in compliance
- **Competency documentation**: Ensure competency assessments are current for all clinical staff
- **Training verification**: Confirm mandatory training is current (HIPAA, infection control, fire safety, cultural competency)
- **Mock interview preparation**: Practice common surveyor questions with front-line staff
- **Environment readiness**: Physical environment tour to identify visible compliance gaps

**Common Surveyor Questions Staff Should Answer:**
- What are the National Patient Safety Goals?
- How do you identify patients before providing care?
- What do you do if you observe a safety concern?
- How do you report an adverse event or near miss?
- Where are the emergency procedures for your area?

### Step 7: Readiness Report Generation

Compile findings into an actionable audit readiness report:

- **Overall readiness score**: Percentage of standards assessed as compliant
- **Critical gaps**: Findings that could result in Condition-level citations or Immediate Threat to Life
- **High-priority items**: Standards with partial compliance requiring remediation before survey
- **Strengths**: Areas of exemplary performance to highlight
- **Remediation timeline**: Prioritized action plan with deadlines and responsible owners
- **Mock survey recommendation**: If readiness score is below threshold, recommend full mock survey

## Analysis Framework

### Audit Readiness Maturity Scale

| Level | Score | Description | Recommendation |
|-------|-------|-------------|----------------|
| Exemplary | 95-100% | Consistently exceeds standards | Maintain; prepare for commendation |
| Survey Ready | 85-94% | Meets standards with minor gaps | Address gaps; proceed with confidence |
| Conditionally Ready | 70-84% | Significant gaps requiring remediation | Intensive preparation; consider mock survey |
| Not Ready | Below 70% | Major compliance gaps | Delay survey if possible; immediate remediation |

## Examples

**Example: Joint Commission Triennial Survey Preparation — 250-Bed Community Hospital**

- Assessment scope: All applicable hospital accreditation standards
- Standards assessed: 287 elements of performance across 14 chapters
- Overall readiness: 88% (Survey Ready)
- Critical gap: Medication management — high-alert medication policies not consistently followed in ED (MM.01.01.03)
- Critical gap: Infection prevention — hand hygiene compliance rate 71% (target 90%) (IC.02.02.01)
- Prior findings: 3 of 4 RFIs from last survey sustained; 1 (patient rights signage) partially regressed
- Documentation audit: 85% compliance on 50-record sample; gaps in discharge medication reconciliation
- Staff readiness: 82% — nursing strong, ancillary departments need refresher on NPSG
- Top 3 actions: (1) ED high-alert medication workflow redesign — 2 weeks, (2) Hand hygiene improvement campaign — 4 weeks, (3) Discharge medication reconciliation training — 2 weeks
- Recommendation: Conduct focused mock survey in ED and procedural areas within 30 days

## Guidelines

1. **Start preparation early** — minimum 6 months before a scheduled Joint Commission survey
2. **Focus on the patient experience** — tracers follow patients, not policies
3. **Ensure policy-practice alignment** — documented policies must match actual practice
4. **Address prior findings first** — repeat findings receive heightened scrutiny
5. **Maintain survey readiness continuously** — do not treat compliance as a periodic event
6. **Engage front-line staff** — surveyors interact with bedside clinicians, not just leadership
7. **Document evidence of compliance** — verbal assurance is insufficient; auditors require documented proof
