# Data Access Governance

## Overview

Establish and enforce comprehensive data access governance for protected health information (PHI) across electronic systems by implementing role-based access control (RBAC), minimum necessary standards, audit logging, anomaly detection, and break-the-glass procedures. HIPAA's Security Rule (45 CFR 164.312(a)) requires access controls as a technical safeguard, and the Privacy Rule (45 CFR 164.502(b)) mandates minimum necessary use and disclosure. This skill operationalizes these requirements into a practical governance framework that balances robust PHI protection with the clinical workflow efficiency needed for patient care delivery.

## When to Use

- Designing or reviewing role-based access control frameworks for EHR and clinical systems
- Conducting periodic user access reviews and recertification
- Investigating suspected unauthorized access to patient records (snooping)
- Implementing minimum necessary standards for PHI access
- Designing break-the-glass procedures for emergency access
- Responding to OCR audit findings related to access controls
- Managing access changes for new hires, role changes, and terminations
- Evaluating access control capabilities during system selection or implementation

## Required Inputs

| Input | Description | Format |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| `system_inventory` | Systems containing PHI with access control capabilities | Structured inventory |
| `role_definitions` | Organizational roles and their PHI access requirements | Structured role matrix |
| `workforce_roster` | Current workforce members with assigned roles and system access | Structured array |
| `access_logs` | System audit logs showing user access to PHI records | Log data |
| `policies` | Access control, minimum necessary, and workforce security policies | Document references |
| `incident_data` | Prior unauthorized access incidents and investigation outcomes | Array of records |
| `regulatory_requirements` | Applicable HIPAA, state privacy law, and accreditation requirements | Reference configuration |

## Methodology

### Step 1: Access Control Framework Design

Establish the organizational access control architecture:

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Model:**

| Role Category | PHI Access Scope | Access Type | Example Roles |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|
| Direct care provider | Own patients (treatment relationship) | Read/Write clinical data | Attending physician, bedside nurse, therapist |
| Care team member | Unit/department patients | Read clinical data, limited write | Charge nurse, care coordinator, social worker |
| Clinical support | Task-specific access | Limited read per function | Lab tech, radiology tech, dietary |
| Administrative | Billing/scheduling relevant data | Read billing/demographic data | Scheduler, registration, billing staff |
| Quality/compliance | Aggregated or audited data | Read with purpose limitation | Quality analyst, compliance officer, auditor |
| IT/technical | System administration | Administrative access with audit | System admin, security analyst |
| Research | Consented/IRB-approved data | Read with protocol limitations | Research coordinator, PI |
| Executive | Aggregate/de-identified data | Dashboard/report access | C-suite, VP operations |

**Minimum Necessary Matrix:**
- For each role, define the minimum PHI data elements needed to perform the job function
- Restrict access to only the data categories required (demographics, clinical notes, labs, imaging, medications, billing)
- Implement view restrictions by patient population (own patients, department, facility, system-wide)
- Define temporal restrictions (how far back historical records are accessible)

### Step 2: Access Provisioning Procedures

Define the lifecycle of access from request through revocation:

**Access Lifecycle Management:**

| Stage | Process | Timeline | Verification |
|-------|---------|----------|-------------|
| Request | Manager submits access request with role justification | At hiring or role change | Role-based template |
| Approval | Data owner or security team reviews and approves | Within 2 business days | Approval documentation |
| Provisioning | IT grants access per approved role template | Within 1 business day of approval | Access confirmation |
| Activation | User acknowledges acceptable use policy and completes training | Before first access | Signed acknowledgment |
| Modification | Role change triggers access review and adjustment | Within 2 business days of role change | Re-certification |
| Suspension | Leave of absence or investigation triggers temporary suspension | Same day as trigger event | Suspension documentation |
| Termination | Employment end triggers immediate access revocation | Within 4 hours of separation (same day) | Revocation confirmation |

**Access Request Approval Authority:**
- Standard access (within role template): Direct supervisor approval
- Elevated access (beyond role template): Department director + Security Officer approval
- Emergency access (break-the-glass): Automatic with retroactive review within 24 hours
- Research access: IRB approval + Privacy Officer review

### Step 3: Minimum Necessary Implementation

Operationalize HIPAA's minimum necessary standard (45 CFR 164.502(b)):

**Minimum Necessary Categories:**
- **Treatment**: Minimum necessary does not apply to disclosures for treatment purposes between providers (45 CFR 164.502(b)(2)(i)) — but organizations may still implement reasonable restrictions
- **Payment**: Limit to data elements needed for the specific payment activity
- **Healthcare operations**: Limit to data needed for the specific operational purpose
- **Workforce access**: Implement role-based restrictions that provide only the data needed for the job function
- **Routine disclosures**: Define standard protocols for recurring disclosure types (e.g., subpoena response, public health reporting)
- **Non-routine disclosures**: Individual review for each non-routine disclosure request

**Implementation Approaches:**
- EHR role templates restricting chart sections by role (e.g., nurses cannot view psychotherapy notes)
- Data element filtering in reports and extracts (include only requested/needed fields)
- Patient population restrictions (providers access only their assigned patients or department)
- Time-based restrictions (access limited to patients with encounters within a defined period)
- Purpose-based access (user must specify reason for accessing record outside their assigned patients)

### Step 4: Audit Logging and Monitoring

Implement comprehensive access monitoring:

**Required Audit Log Elements (45 CFR 164.312(b)):**
- User ID and role at time of access
- Date and time of access
- Patient record accessed (patient identifier)
- Action performed (view, create, modify, print, export, delete)
- System or application accessed
- Access location (workstation ID, IP address, remote/on-site)

**Proactive Monitoring Program:**

| Monitoring Type | Frequency | Trigger Criteria | Response |
|----------------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Routine audit log review | Monthly | Random sample of access records | Verify access appropriateness |
| High-profile patient monitoring | Real-time | Access to VIP, employee, or flagged patient records | Immediate alert and review |
| Volume anomaly detection | Daily | User accessing significantly more records than peer average | Investigation trigger |
| After-hours access review | Weekly | Access outside assigned work hours | Verification of clinical justification |
| Relationship verification | Continuous | Access to records without treatment relationship | Alert and justification request |
| Break-the-glass review | Within 24 hours | Every emergency access override | Mandatory justification review |
| Terminated user monitoring | Real-time | Any access attempt by terminated user | Immediate security alert |

### Step 5: Unauthorized Access Detection and Investigation

Detect and investigate potential unauthorized access (snooping):

**Detection Indicators:**
- Accessing records of family members, neighbors, celebrities, or co-workers without treatment relationship
- Accessing own medical record through clinical system (rather than patient portal)
- Accessing records after treatment relationship has ended without legitimate purpose
- Accessing records from unusual locations or at unusual times
- Accessing records flagged for heightened monitoring (VIP, employee health)
- Pattern of accessing records matching news events (accident victims, crime victims)

**Investigation Process:**
1. Preserve audit log evidence
2. Identify the accessed records and the accessor
3. Determine if a treatment relationship or legitimate business purpose existed
4. Interview the accessor to understand the reason for access
5. Review organizational policy and HIPAA requirements
6. Determine if a privacy violation occurred
7. If violation confirmed: apply sanctions per sanction policy, determine if breach notification is required
8. Document the investigation and outcome

**Sanction Policy Application:**
- First offense, no harm: Verbal warning and re-education
- Repeat offense or minor harm: Written warning and remedial training
- Intentional or significant: Suspension, termination, and potential referral to OCR
- All violations: Documented in employee file per organizational sanction policy (required by 45 CFR 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(C))

### Step 6: Break-the-Glass Procedures

Design emergency access override protocols:

**When Break-the-Glass Applies:**
- Medical emergency requiring immediate access to patient information not normally accessible to the user
- System failure preventing normal access for active patient care
- Disaster or mass casualty event requiring expanded access

**Break-the-Glass Requirements:**
- User must acknowledge emergency access is being activated
- System logs the break-the-glass event with enhanced detail
- User must provide justification within 24 hours
- Privacy/Security Officer reviews every break-the-glass event
- Inappropriate use of break-the-glass is subject to sanctions
- Break-the-glass rates are monitored (high rates may indicate role template inadequacy)

### Step 7: Periodic Access Review and Recertification

Conduct regular reviews of access appropriateness:

**Review Schedule:**

| Review Type | Frequency | Scope | Reviewer |
|------------|-----------|-------|----------|
| New user access | 30 days after provisioning | Individual access vs. role template | Direct supervisor |
| Department access review | Quarterly | All users in department vs. role templates | Department director |
| Privileged access | Monthly | Admin, IT, and elevated access users | Security Officer |
| Comprehensive recertification | Semi-annual | All users across all systems | Department director + Security |
| Terminated user audit | Monthly | Verify all terminated users have been revoked | HR + IT Security |
| Vendor/BA access review | Quarterly | All external access accounts | Security Officer + Vendor Manager |

**Recertification Process:**
- Generate access report showing each user's current access rights
- Manager certifies that each user's access is appropriate for current role
- Identify and remove excess access (access creep from prior roles)
- Document recertification completion with manager attestation
- Escalate unresolved excess access to Security Officer

## Analysis Framework

### Access Control Maturity Model

| Level | Description | Characteristics |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| Level 1 — Ad Hoc | Access granted without structured framework | No role definitions, broad access, no monitoring |
| Level 2 — Defined | RBAC framework exists with basic provisioning | Role templates, manual reviews, limited monitoring |
| Level 3 — Managed | Active monitoring and periodic recertification | Audit log review, anomaly alerts, quarterly recertification |
| Level 4 — Optimized | Automated governance with continuous monitoring | Real-time anomaly detection, automated provisioning/deprovisioning, break-the-glass analytics |

## Examples

**Example: Hospital EHR Access Governance Audit**

- Scope: 2,500 EHR users across 450-bed hospital
- RBAC assessment: 28 role templates defined; 92% of users aligned to templates; 8% (200 users) have customized access requiring review
- Minimum necessary: Clinical notes restricted by role; billing staff cannot view psychotherapy notes — compliant
- Provisioning: Average provisioning time 1.2 days (compliant); average termination revocation 6.8 hours (within 4-hour target for 85% of terminations)
- Critical finding: 12 orphaned accounts from employees terminated 30+ days ago still active — immediate revocation required
- Monitoring: 1,847 anomaly alerts in past quarter; 23 investigations initiated; 3 confirmed unauthorized access (2 employee record access, 1 celebrity patient)
- Break-the-glass: 45 events in quarter; 42 justified; 3 inappropriate (sanctions applied)
- Recommendation: Implement automated account deactivation triggered by HR termination record; reduce orphaned account gap to zero

## Guidelines

1. **Access is a privilege, not a right** — all PHI access must be justified by job function
2. **Implement least privilege** — default to minimum access; add only when justified
3. **Automate provisioning and deprovisioning** — manual processes are error-prone and slow
4. **Monitor continuously** — periodic audits alone are insufficient; implement real-time anomaly detection
5. **Apply sanctions consistently** — inconsistent enforcement undermines the entire governance program
6. **Review break-the-glass events promptly** — within 24 hours of every occurrence
7. **Address access creep** — users who change roles accumulate excess access unless actively managed
