# Provider Capacity Forecasting

## Overview

This skill forecasts provider capacity supply and demand across specialties and service lines using wRVU (work Relative Value Unit) productivity analysis, patient panel modeling, demographic demand projections, and workforce pipeline data. It enables health systems to anticipate shortages 6-24 months ahead, optimize existing capacity allocation, and make evidence-based recruitment and expansion decisions. The AAMC projects a physician shortage of 37,800 to 124,000 by 2034, making proactive capacity planning essential for ensuring access and financial sustainability.

## When to Use

- Annual strategic workforce planning and recruitment prioritization
- Evaluating capacity impact of new service lines, facility expansions, or acquisitions
- Assessing impact of provider retirements, departures, or leave on access
- Optimizing provider-to-patient panel ratios across primary care sites
- Preparing for value-based care population health management requirements
- Responding to access complaints or growing appointment wait times
- Informing GME program development and advanced practice provider deployment

## Methodology

### Step 1: Current Capacity Inventory
- Enumerate current provider capacity by specialty:
  - Total FTE by specialty and location
  - Clinical FTE (adjusted for administrative, research, teaching, and leadership time)
  - wRVU production per clinical FTE vs. MGMA/AMGA benchmarks:
    - Family Medicine median: 4,200-4,800 wRVU/yr
    - Internal Medicine median: 4,500-5,200 wRVU/yr
    - Cardiology median: 7,000-8,500 wRVU/yr
    - Orthopedic Surgery median: 8,000-10,000 wRVU/yr
    - Psychiatry median: 3,800-4,500 wRVU/yr
  - Panel size per primary care provider (target: 1,800-2,500 empaneled patients per 1.0 FTE)
  - Advanced practice provider (APP) capacity as physician-equivalent FTE (typically 0.6-0.8)
- Identify capacity at risk:
  - Providers within 5 years of typical retirement age (65)
  - Contract expirations within 12 months
  - Known leave plans (parental, sabbatical, medical)
  - Burnout risk indicators (cross-reference with burnout detection skill)

### Step 2: Demand Modeling
- Project patient demand by specialty:
  - **Demographic demand**: Apply age-sex utilization rates to population projections
    - Use CMS utilization data or proprietary actuarial tables
    - Account for aging population effects (65+ population growing 3.2% annually)
    - Incorporate migration and growth patterns from census and planning data
  - **Epidemiological demand**: Disease prevalence trends affecting specialty need
    - Obesity, diabetes, behavioral health prevalence trajectories
    - Post-pandemic behavioral health demand surge
  - **Market demand**: Competitive landscape and market share assumptions
    - New entrants, competitor expansions, payer network changes
  - **Programmatic demand**: Planned service line expansions, new contracts, VBC populations
  - **Regulatory demand**: Changing screening guidelines, quality measure requirements
- Express demand in required wRVU capacity and required FTE by specialty

### Step 3: Supply-Demand Gap Analysis
- Calculate gap for each specialty and location:
  - Gap = Projected Demand FTE - (Current FTE - Attrition + Pipeline)
  - Positive gap = shortage (need more providers)
  - Negative gap = surplus (potential for redeployment or growth absorption)
- Project gaps at 6-month, 12-month, 18-month, and 24-month horizons
- Sensitivity analysis: model optimistic, baseline, and pessimistic scenarios
  - Optimistic: low attrition, strong recruitment, moderate demand growth
  - Baseline: historical attrition, expected recruitment, projected demand
  - Pessimistic: high attrition, limited recruitment, accelerated demand

### Step 4: Financial Impact Assessment
- Quantify financial impact of capacity gaps:
  - Revenue at risk from unfilled demand (wRVU gap x revenue per wRVU)
  - Recruitment cost per specialty (MGMA benchmark: 25K-50K per physician)
  - Ramp-up time to full productivity (typically 12-18 months for new physicians)
  - Locum tenens cost for interim coverage vs. permanent hire
  - Lost downstream revenue from referral leakage due to access constraints
- Calculate ROI for recruitment investments and APP expansion

### Step 5: Optimization Strategies
- Generate capacity optimization recommendations before new recruitment:
  - **Schedule optimization**: Reduce no-shows, optimize template utilization
  - **APP deployment**: Expand APP scope for routine visits, freeing physician capacity
  - **Telehealth expansion**: Convert appropriate visit types to virtual (typically 20-30% eligible)
  - **Team-based care**: Implement collaborative practice models (RN care management, pharmacist MTM)
  - **Panel rebalancing**: Redistribute patients across providers to equalize workload
  - **Efficiency improvements**: Reduce EHR burden, streamline workflows, add scribes
- Estimate FTE equivalents recovered from each optimization strategy

### Step 6: Recruitment Priority Ranking
- Rank specialties for recruitment priority using weighted scoring:
  - Access gap severity (wait time above benchmark): 25% weight
  - Revenue impact: 20% weight
  - Strategic alignment (VBC, service line growth): 20% weight
  - Attrition risk: 15% weight
  - Community need (HPSA designation, CHNA findings): 10% weight
  - Competitive vulnerability: 10% weight
- Generate recruitment timeline with realistic onboarding assumptions

## Analysis Framework

Apply the **AAMC Workforce Planning Model** adapted for health system use:
1. **Supply modeling**: Current inventory + pipeline - projected attrition
2. **Demand modeling**: Population demographics x utilization rates + programmatic demand
3. **Gap analysis**: Supply - demand = shortage or surplus
4. **Intervention modeling**: Optimization, recruitment, and scope expansion strategies
5. **Financial modeling**: Revenue impact, investment requirements, ROI

## Examples

**Example: Regional Health System Workforce Forecast**
- System: 8 hospitals, 120 ambulatory sites, 1,200 providers
- Critical shortages identified (24-month): Psychiatry (gap: 8.2 FTE), Gastroenterology (gap: 4.5 FTE), Primary Care (gap: 12.0 FTE)
- Surplus identified: General Surgery (surplus: 2.1 FTE, absorbed by new trauma center)
- Optimization potential: Telehealth expansion in primary care = 3.5 FTE equivalent, APP deployment in GI = 2.0 FTE equivalent
- Net recruitment need: Psychiatry 6 positions, GI 2 positions, Primary Care 8 positions
- Revenue at risk without action: 14.2M annually from primary care leakage alone
- Recruitment investment: 2.1M estimated with 18-month ROI

## Guidelines

- **HIPAA Compliance**: Workforce analytics do not typically involve PHI but may reference patient volumes. Ensure any patient data used in demand modeling is aggregated and de-identified. Provider productivity data should be handled per employment confidentiality policies.
- **Data Quality**: wRVU data must account for provider ramp-up periods, leave, and part-time status. Normalize productivity to clinical FTE, not total FTE. Validate data against billing system and EHR independently.
- **Market Sensitivity**: Recruitment priority rankings and compensation benchmarks are competitively sensitive. Restrict distribution to strategic planning leadership.
- **Equity Lens**: Evaluate whether capacity gaps disproportionately affect underserved communities (HPSA, MUA designations). Prioritize recruitment that addresses health equity gaps.
- **Scenario Planning**: Never present a single forecast as definitive. Always provide scenario ranges with explicit assumptions documented.
