# Risk Adjustment Support

## Overview

This skill analyzes diagnostic coding patterns, clinical documentation, and claims data to identify risk adjustment opportunities and documentation gaps. It applies CMS-HCC v28 model logic, RAF score calculations, and coding accuracy validation to support compliant revenue integrity for Medicare Advantage, ACA marketplace, and Medicaid managed care programs.

## When to Use

- Identifying suspected HCC coding gaps where conditions are documented but not captured in claims
- Validating RAF score accuracy against clinical documentation
- Preparing for CMS Risk Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) audits
- Analyzing year-over-year RAF score trends and explaining variances
- Prioritizing provider education on condition documentation and specificity
- Estimating revenue impact of coding accuracy improvements

## Required Inputs

| Input | Description | Format |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Diagnosis claims | ICD-10-CM codes with claim type, provider, DOS | Claims detail |
| Member demographics | DOB, sex, Medicaid dual status, disability status | Enrollment file |
| CMS-HCC model mappings | ICD-10 to HCC crosswalk (v28) | Reference table |
| RAF score output | Current and prior year RAF scores by member | Score file |
| Clinical notes (optional) | Provider documentation for chart review validation | Unstructured text |
| Pharmacy claims (optional) | Medication history for condition inference | Rx claims |

## Methodology

### Step 1 — Map Diagnoses to HCC Categories

Process all diagnosis codes through the CMS-HCC v28 model:

- Map each ICD-10-CM code to its HCC category using the official CMS crosswalk
- Apply hierarchical logic: when multiple HCCs exist within a hierarchy, retain only the most severe
- Handle interaction terms (e.g., diabetes + CHF interaction, HCC 18 × HCC 85)
- Calculate demographic base score (age/sex/disability/dual status factors)
- Compute total RAF score: demographic factor + sum of HCC coefficients + interaction terms

### Step 2 — Identify Suspected Coding Gaps

Detect conditions likely present but not captured in current-year claims:

- **Historical drop-off**: Conditions coded in prior year but absent in current year (chronic conditions should persist)
- **Pharmacy inference**: Active prescriptions suggesting uncoded conditions (e.g., insulin without diabetes HCC, anticoagulants without AFib HCC)
- **Lab inference**: Abnormal lab values without corresponding diagnosis (e.g., eGFR < 60 without CKD code)
- **Clinical plausibility**: Comorbidity patterns suggesting missing conditions (e.g., diabetes complications without base diabetes code)

### Step 3 — Assess Documentation Specificity

Review coding specificity for revenue-impacting distinctions:

- **Diabetes**: E11.65 (with hyperglycemia, HCC 18) vs. E11.9 (without complication, HCC 19) — significant RAF difference
- **CKD staging**: N18.3 (stage 3, HCC 329) vs. N18.4 (stage 4, HCC 328) — higher RAF for advanced stages
- **Heart failure**: I50.22 (chronic systolic, HCC 85) vs. I50.9 (unspecified, HCC 85) — specificity supports RADV
- **Malnutrition**: E43 (severe, HCC 21) vs. E44.1 (mild, HCC 23) — major coefficient difference

### Step 4 — Quantify Revenue Impact

Calculate the financial impact of identified gaps and specificity improvements:

- Per-member RAF impact: multiply HCC coefficient by the CMS normalization factor and base rate
- Aggregate revenue impact: sum across identified members, apply expected capture rate (typically 60-80%)
- Segment by: condition category, provider, clinic site, and line of business
- Model scenarios: best case (100% capture), expected (70% capture), conservative (40% capture)

### Step 5 — Prioritize Provider Outreach

Rank opportunities for provider engagement:

| Priority | Criteria | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Critical | High-RAF HCCs with strong clinical evidence, RADV risk | Immediate chart review + provider query |
| High | Historical drop-offs for well-documented chronic conditions | Prospective visit preparation |
| Medium | Pharmacy/lab inferred gaps needing clinical confirmation | Pre-visit medical record review |
| Low | Specificity improvements with modest RAF impact | Provider education sessions |

### Step 6 — Validate Compliance Guardrails

Ensure all risk adjustment activities comply with CMS guidelines:

- Confirm every HCC is supported by face-to-face encounter documentation
- Verify conditions meet MEAT criteria (Monitor, Evaluate, Assess/Address, Treat)
- Check that diagnoses are not carried forward without clinical re-evaluation
- Ensure no upcoding: codes must be supported by clinical documentation
- Flag any patterns suggesting problematic coding (e.g., identical HCC profiles across large patient panels)

### Step 7 — Generate RADV-Ready Documentation

Prepare audit-ready artifacts:

- Member-level HCC inventory with supporting claim references
- Documentation sufficiency scores per HCC (high/medium/low confidence)
- Provider attestation tracking for condition recapture
- Trend analysis showing RAF score changes with explanatory narratives

## Analysis Framework

### RAF Score Benchmarking

| Population | Expected Avg RAF | Low Concern | Investigate |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| MA general | 0.95 - 1.10 | 0.85 - 1.20 | < 0.80 or > 1.30 |
| MA D-SNP | 1.30 - 1.60 | 1.10 - 1.80 | < 1.00 or > 2.00 |
| ACA Individual | 1.00 - 1.20 | 0.90 - 1.40 | < 0.80 or > 1.50 |

### HCC Impact Tiers (v28 Approximate Coefficients)

- **Tier 1 (RAF > 0.30)**: Severe conditions — transplant status, protein-calorie malnutrition, quadriplegia
- **Tier 2 (RAF 0.15-0.30)**: Major chronic — diabetes with complications, CHF, COPD, vascular disease
- **Tier 3 (RAF 0.05-0.15)**: Moderate chronic — specified arrhythmias, CKD 3, rheumatoid arthritis
- **Tier 4 (RAF < 0.05)**: Lower impact — hypertension (no longer in HCC model), obesity, depression

## Examples

**Example 1 — MA Plan Annual Coding Review**
Analyze 50,000 MA members. Identify 8,200 suspected HCC gaps based on historical drop-off (4,100), pharmacy inference (2,800), and lab inference (1,300). Estimate $12.4M in recoverable revenue at 70% capture rate. Prioritize top 15 provider groups covering 60% of gaps for prospective chart review.

**Example 2 — RADV Audit Preparation**
Prepare for CMS RADV audit on 200 sampled members. Score documentation confidence for each claimed HCC. Flag 34 HCCs across 22 members with low documentation confidence for pre-audit chart improvement. Estimate financial exposure of $890K if flagged HCCs are invalidated.

## Guidelines

- Use the CMS-HCC model version applicable to the current payment year (v28 for PY2025+)
- Never recommend adding diagnosis codes without supporting clinical documentation — this constitutes fraud
- Distinguish between compliant coding accuracy improvement and impermissible upcoding
- Apply CMS normalization factor to RAF scores when calculating revenue impact
- Account for coding intensity factor (CIF) adjustments applied by CMS to MA plans
- Track and report recapture rates separately from new condition capture

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] All HCC mappings use current CMS-HCC crosswalk version
- [ ] Suspected gaps have at least one supporting evidence type (historical, pharmacy, lab, clinical)
- [ ] Revenue calculations use current CMS base rate and normalization factor
- [ ] Compliance guardrails have been applied to every recommendation
- [ ] No recommendations suggest coding without face-to-face encounter documentation
- [ ] RADV confidence scores are calibrated against historical audit outcomes
- [ ] Provider scorecards use peer-adjusted benchmarks (specialty, panel complexity)
