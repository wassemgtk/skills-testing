# Diagnostic Support Summaries

## Overview

Generate comprehensive, evidence-based diagnostic summaries that synthesize a patient's clinical presentation, examination findings, and test results into structured differential diagnoses with supporting evidence. This skill applies validated diagnostic criteria, Bayesian clinical reasoning, and evidence-based medicine principles to support — not replace — physician diagnostic decision-making.

## When to Use

- Synthesizing complex clinical presentations into structured differentials
- Preparing diagnostic case summaries for conferences or consultations
- Summarizing diagnostic workup progress with next-step recommendations
- Supporting clinical reasoning with evidence-based diagnostic criteria
- Generating teaching case summaries for medical education
- Documenting diagnostic reasoning for medical-legal purposes

## Required Inputs

| Input | Description | Format |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Clinical presentation | Symptoms, duration, progression, associated features | Structured HPI |
| Physical exam findings | Pertinent positives and negatives by system | Structured exam |
| Diagnostic test results | Labs, imaging, pathology, special tests | Structured results with reference ranges |
| Patient context | Age, sex, comorbidities, medications, risk factors | Structured demographics |
| Clinical question | Specific diagnostic question being addressed | Free text |

## Methodology

### Step 1: Clinical Data Organization

Structure the clinical information using a systematic framework:

**Presenting Syndrome Identification:**
- Identify the primary presenting syndrome (e.g., acute chest pain, chronic cough, unexplained weight loss)
- Classify by organ system, acuity (acute/subacute/chronic), and severity
- Note temporal pattern (sudden, gradual, intermittent, progressive)

**Pertinent Feature Extraction:**
- Pertinent positives: findings that support specific diagnoses
- Pertinent negatives: findings that argue against specific diagnoses
- Red flags: findings suggesting dangerous or emergent conditions
- Pattern recognition: classic presentation patterns (e.g., pleuritic chest pain + dyspnea + recent immobilization = PE concern)

### Step 2: Differential Diagnosis Generation

Build a prioritized differential using anatomic, pathophysiologic, and probabilistic reasoning:

**Framework: "VINDICATE + P"**
- **V**ascular: thrombotic, embolic, hemorrhagic, vasculitic
- **I**nfectious: bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic
- **N**eoplastic: primary, metastatic, paraneoplastic
- **D**egenerative: wear-and-tear, aging-related
- **I**atrogenic/Intoxication: drug-related, procedure-related
- **C**ongenital: genetic, developmental
- **A**utoimmune/Allergic: systemic autoimmune, organ-specific
- **T**raumatic: acute injury, repetitive stress
- **E**ndocrine/Metabolic: hormonal, electrolyte, metabolic
- **P**sychogenic: functional, somatoform, psychiatric

### Step 3: Evidence Mapping

For each differential diagnosis, map the supporting and refuting evidence:

**Diagnostic Criteria Application:**
- Apply validated diagnostic criteria where available (e.g., Duke criteria for endocarditis, SLICC criteria for SLE, Light criteria for pleural effusion)
- Calculate pre-test probability using clinical prediction rules where applicable (Wells score for PE, CHA2DS2-VASc for stroke risk)
- Note sensitivity and specificity of key findings for each diagnosis

**Evidence Strength for Each Diagnosis:**
- Strong support: pathognomonic finding or multiple concordant features
- Moderate support: several consistent features, some expected features absent
- Weak support: possible but fewer consistent features
- Against: key expected features absent or contradictory findings present

### Step 4: Workup Assessment

Evaluate the current diagnostic workup status:

- **Completed tests**: results and their diagnostic implications
- **Pending tests**: expected timeline and what they will clarify
- **Recommended next tests**: prioritized by diagnostic yield and clinical urgency
- **Test characteristics**: sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios for recommended tests

### Step 5: Summary Generation

Produce the diagnostic support summary:

**Summary Components:**
1. One-sentence clinical synopsis
2. Ranked differential with probability estimates and evidence basis
3. Key supporting/refuting evidence for top 3 diagnoses
4. Current workup status with pending and recommended tests
5. Clinical reasoning narrative connecting evidence to diagnoses
6. Urgency assessment for time-sensitive diagnoses

## Output Specification

The output includes:

**clinical_synopsis**: one-sentence summary of the case

**presenting_syndrome**: syndrome name, organ_system, acuity, severity

**differential_diagnoses** (ranked list): diagnosis name, icd10, probability_estimate (high/moderate/low/unlikely), supporting_evidence list, refuting_evidence list, diagnostic_criteria_met (criteria name, elements met, elements total), key_discriminating_tests

**workup_status**: completed_tests (test, result, interpretation, diagnostic_implication), pending_tests (test, expected_turnaround, diagnostic_question), recommended_tests (test, rationale, sensitivity, specificity, urgency)

**clinical_reasoning_narrative**: prose explaining the diagnostic logic

**urgency_flags**: time-sensitive diagnoses requiring immediate action

**evidence_references**: guideline or literature citations supporting the analysis

## Analysis Framework

### Diagnostic Probability Stratification

| Probability Tier | Estimated Likelihood | Action |
|-----------------|---------------------|--------|
| Must not miss | Any probability, high severity | Rule out immediately regardless of probability |
| High probability | Greater than 50% | Primary working diagnosis, confirm |
| Moderate probability | 15-50% | Active differential, targeted testing |
| Low probability | 5-15% | Consider if initial workup negative |
| Unlikely | Less than 5% | Do not pursue unless red flags emerge |

### Pre-Test to Post-Test Probability

Apply likelihood ratios to update diagnostic probabilities:

- LR+ greater than 10: Strong rule-in (large increase in probability)
- LR+ 5-10: Moderate rule-in
- LR+ 2-5: Small increase in probability
- LR- 0.2-0.5: Small decrease in probability
- LR- 0.1-0.2: Moderate rule-out
- LR- less than 0.1: Strong rule-out (large decrease in probability)

## Examples

**Input**: 45-year-old female presenting with 3 weeks of progressive fatigue, joint pain (MCPs and wrists bilateral), morning stiffness lasting over 60 minutes, and new malar rash. ANA positive 1:640, dsDNA positive, C3/C4 low, CBC shows mild leukopenia.

**Diagnostic Summary (abbreviated)**:
- Synopsis: 45F with polyarthritis, malar rash, and serologic findings concerning for systemic lupus erythematosus
- Top Differential:
  1. SLE (HIGH) — meets 4+ SLICC criteria (arthritis, malar rash, ANA+, dsDNA+, low complement, leukopenia). Criteria: 4/11 ACR or 4/17 SLICC met
  2. Mixed connective tissue disease (LOW) — overlapping features but anti-U1 RNP not tested
  3. Rheumatoid arthritis (LOW) — symmetric small joint arthritis fits, but rash and serology favor SLE
- Recommended: anti-Smith antibody, anti-U1 RNP, urinalysis with microscopy (lupus nephritis screening), anti-CCP (RA differentiation), complement levels trending
- Urgency: Renal involvement screening is time-sensitive

## Guidelines

1. **This is decision support, not diagnosis** — all output requires physician review and clinical judgment
2. **Must-not-miss diagnoses always appear** regardless of probability (e.g., PE in chest pain, SAH in headache)
3. **Apply Occam's razor judiciously** — prefer one unifying diagnosis but acknowledge when multiple diagnoses are more likely
4. **Cite diagnostic criteria explicitly** — specify which criteria are met and which are not
5. **Quantify uncertainty** — use probability tiers rather than definitive statements

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] All pertinent positives and negatives from the input are addressed
- [ ] Differential diagnoses are prioritized by probability and severity
- [ ] Must-not-miss diagnoses are included regardless of probability
- [ ] Diagnostic criteria are applied correctly with elements enumerated
- [ ] Recommended tests are prioritized by diagnostic yield and urgency
- [ ] Clinical reasoning narrative is logically coherent

## HIPAA Compliance Notes

- Diagnostic summaries contain sensitive PHI including diagnoses and test results
- When used for teaching or case conferences, fully de-identify per Safe Harbor (remove all 18 identifiers)
- Store diagnostic support outputs in the medical record system under appropriate access controls
- Ensure AI-generated diagnostic summaries are clearly labeled as decision support, not final diagnoses
- Maintain audit trails for all diagnostic summary generation and access
